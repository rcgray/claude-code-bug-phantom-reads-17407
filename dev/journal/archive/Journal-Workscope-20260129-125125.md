## Initialization

- Read PRD.md (project introduction)
- Completed WSD Boot: read Agent-System.md, Agent-Rules.md, Design-Decisions.md, Documentation-System.md, Checkboxlist-System.md, Workscope-System.md
- Generated Workscope ID: 20260129-125125
- Created Work Journal at dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260129-125125.md
- Custom workscope mode (`--custom`): awaiting User assignment

## Custom Workscope: Create Build Scan Discrepancy Analysis File

User requested creation of a placeholder analysis file for the Build Scan Discrepancy Investigation, following the pattern established by `Barebones-216-Analysis.md`. The file will be progressively filled in by subsequent User Agents as they work through the investigation phases.

### Work Performed

- Read `docs/experiments/planning/Barebones-216.md` (example planning doc)
- Read `docs/experiments/results/Barebones-216-Analysis.md` (example analysis doc — pattern to follow)
- Read `docs/experiments/planning/Build-Scan-Discrepancy-Investigation.md` (investigation plan)
- Read `docs/experiments/results/Experiment-04-BuildScan.md` (related build scan results, for context)
- Created `docs/experiments/results/Build-Scan-Discrepancy-Analysis.md` with:
  - Preliminary findings (reproduced from planning doc as baseline)
  - Phase 1 placeholders: Steps 1.1–1.4 with comparison tables
  - Phase 1 Synthesis placeholder
  - Phase 2 placeholders: Steps 2.1–2.3 with trial result tables
  - Phase 2 Synthesis placeholder
  - Phase 3 placeholders: Steps 3.1 (X+Y model revision) and 3.2 (Build Scan impact)
  - Research Question placeholders: RQ-BSD-1 through RQ-BSD-5
  - Executive Summary and Conclusions placeholders (to be written last)
