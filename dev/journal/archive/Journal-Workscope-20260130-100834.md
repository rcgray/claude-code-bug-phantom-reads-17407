### Custom Workscope: Process Prompt Log

Received `/process-prompt-log dev/todo/Prompts-2026-01-26_113511.txt`

**Phase 1: Read and Extract**
- Prompt log covers date: 2026-01-26
- Contains 8 sessions covering: Experiments 04L, 04A, 04K, 04D analysis; Research Questions catalog creation; Token Accounting clarification; Documentation Reorganization; Timeline creation; `/process-prompt-log` command creation
- Read all three target documents: Timeline.md, Investigation-Journal.md, Research-Questions.md
- Also read Post-Experiment-04-Ideas.md for full experiment context

**Phase 2: Cross-Reference**
- Found that most content was already documented (this log covers sessions where the documentation was initially created)
- Identified gaps: Documentation reorganization, `/process-prompt-log` creation, X+Y interaction refinement, 04D context saturation observation, Experiment-04M design

**Phase 3: Report Findings**
- Presented structured analysis to User
- Categorized as "minor" updates initially - User corrected: these represent the start of the final investigation chapter
