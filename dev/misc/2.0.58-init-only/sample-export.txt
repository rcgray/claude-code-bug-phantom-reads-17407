⏺ I acknowledge that I have read the content in the
  wsd-init-project-introduction section. This is the "Phantom Reads
  Investigation" project - a git repository for publishing on GitHub that
  provides an experiment to reproduce Claude Code Issue #17407 ("Phantom
  Reads"). Let me read the required documents.

⏺ Read(docs/core/PRD.md)
  ⎿  Read 213 lines

⏺ Read(docs/core/Experiment-Methodology.md)
  ⎿  Read 223 lines

⏺ Read(docs/core/Action-Plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 128 lines

⏺ I've read the required project documents. Now let me run the /wsd:boot
  command to understand the Workscope-Dev Platform.

> /wsd:boot is running… 

⏺ I have read all the WSD Platform system documentation. Now let me continue
   with the initialization process.

  Workscope ID Generation

⏺ Bash(date "+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
  ⎿  20260112-170

⏺ Workscope ID: 20260112-170310

  Work Journal Initialization

⏺ Bash(bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh "20260112-170310")
  ⎿  Work Journal initialized: dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscop
     0260112-170310.md
     Timestamp: 2026-01-12 17:03
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me verify the Work Journal was created properly:

⏺ Read(dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260112-170310.md)
  ⎿  Read 4 lines

⏺ The Work Journal exists and is properly formed.

  Custom Workscope (--custom flag)

  Since the --custom flag was provided, I need to run the /wsd:onboard
  command to collect onboarding context from the Project-Bootstrapper before
   returning to the User for a custom workscope assignment.

> /wsd:onboard is running… 

⏺ I'll consult the Project-Bootstrapper agent for onboarding. Since this is
  a --custom workscope, I don't yet have a specific workscope assignment,
  but I can describe the project context.

⏺ project-bootstrapper(Project bootstrapper onboarding)
  ⎿  Done (17 tool uses · 57.6k tokens · 1m 37s)                           

⏺ I've received the onboarding briefing from the Project-Bootstrapper. Now I
   need to read all the mandatory files listed. I've already read several of
   these during the /wsd:boot command, but let me read the remaining
  standards files I haven't yet read:

⏺ Read(docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md)
  ⎿  Read 18 lines

⏺ Read(docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md)
  ⎿  Read 35 lines

⏺ Read(docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md)
  ⎿  Read 445 lines

⏺ Read(docs/read-only/standards/Process-Integrity-Standards.md)
  ⎿  Read 140 lines

⏺ I have now read all the mandatory files. Let me update my Work Journal
  with the onboarding information:

⏺ Update(dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260112-170310.md)
  ⎿  Updated dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260112-170310.md with 
     39 additions

  - Updated my Work Journal with the complete list of files read
  - Documented key rules to remember

  Returning to /wsd:init completion...

  "WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: 
  propose changes, describe the workscope, or /wsd:prepare. To abandon 
  completely, /wsd:abort."
