     1→# Implement Centralized Error Registry Pattern
     2→
     3→## Overview
     4→
     5→This refactor introduces a centralized Error Registry pattern to standardize error handling across all modules of the Data Pipeline System. Currently, each module implements its own error handling approach with module-specific error codes, structures, and propagation patterns. This creates inconsistency in error reporting, complicates cross-module error correlation, and makes it difficult to implement unified error monitoring and alerting.

     7→The Error Registry will serve as a single source of truth for all error definitions, providing standardized error codes, severity classifications, and recovery guidance. Each module will register its errors with the central registry and use registry-provided utilities for error creation, logging, and propagation. This approach enables consistent error handling, simplified debugging, and improved operational visibility across the entire pipeline.

     9→## Required Context
    10→
    11→This cross-cutting refactor requires thorough review of ALL specification files:
    12→
    13→**You MUST thoroughly review each file listed below. Each module's error handling must be analyzed in detail to understand the current error patterns before designing the Error Registry.**
    14→
    15→Primary Specifications:
    16→- `docs/specs/data-pipeline-overview.md` - System architecture and module relationships
    17→- `docs/specs/module-alpha.md` - Ingestion module error handling patterns
    18→- `docs/specs/module-beta.md` - Transformation module error handling patterns
    19→- `docs/specs/module-gamma.md` - Output module error handling patterns
    20→- `docs/specs/integration-layer.md` - Cross-module error propagation (CRITICAL)
    21→- `docs/specs/compliance-requirements.md` - Error logging compliance requirements

    23→## Tasks
    24→
    25→### Phase 1: Core Design
    26→
    27→- [ ] **1.1** - Design the ErrorRegistry interface with methods for error registration, lookup, and creation
    28→- [ ] **1.2** - Define the standardized ErrorDefinition structure with code, severity, category, and recovery hints
    29→- [ ] **1.3** - Create error code namespace conventions for each module (ALPHA_xxx, BETA_xxx, GAMMA_xxx, INT_xxx)
    30→- [ ] **1.4** - Implement error severity levels aligned with compliance requirements (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
    31→- [ ] **1.5** - Design the error propagation protocol for cross-module error chains
    32→
    33→### Phase 2: Module Integration
    34→
    35→- [ ] **2.1** - Update Module Alpha error handling to use the Error Registry for all connection, parse, validation, and buffer errors
    36→- [ ] **2.2** - Update Module Beta error handling to use the Error Registry for mapping, transformation, enrichment, and quality errors
    37→- [ ] **2.3** - Update Module Gamma error handling to use the Error Registry for rendering, routing, delivery, and acknowledgment errors
    38→- [ ] **2.4** - Update the Integration Layer to use Error Registry for all inter-module error propagation
    39→
    40→### Phase 3: Observability
    41→
    42→- [ ] **3.1** - Implement error correlation tracking using the registry's correlation ID management
    43→- [ ] **3.2** - Create error metrics integration for registry-based error counting and rate calculation
    44→- [ ] **3.3** - Update audit logging to use standardized error formats from the registry
    45→- [ ] **3.4** - Implement error recovery suggestion lookup based on error code and context

<system-reminder>
Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.
