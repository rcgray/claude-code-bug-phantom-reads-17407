     2→
     3→**Version:** 1.0.0
     4→**Audience:** Developers using WSD for AI-assisted development
     5→
     6→## Introduction
     7→
     8→This guide covers the day-to-day use of Workscope-Dev (WSD) after installation and setup. It explains the workscope lifecycle, available commands, and how to work effectively with the agent system.
     9→
    10→For installation, see `Integration-Guide.md`. For platform-specific configuration, see the relevant project guide (`Python-Project-Guide.md`, `Node-Project-Guide.md`, or `Codeless-Project-Guide.md`).
    11→
    12→## The Workscope Lifecycle
    13→
    14→WSD organizes AI-assisted development into discrete units of work called **workscopes**. Each workscope represents a well-defined set of tasks suitable for a single AI session. The lifecycle follows a structured sequence that ensures quality, traceability, and effective handoffs.
    15→

    42→```
    43→
    44→### Phase 1: Initialization (`/wsd:init`)
    45→
    46→The initialization phase prepares a fresh AI session (User Agent) for work.
    47→
    48→**What happens:**
    49→1. The User Agent reads critical WSD system documentation to understand components and workflow
    50→2. A unique Workscope ID is generated from the current timestamp (format: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`)
    51→3. A Work Journal is created at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-{ID}.md`
    52→4. The Task-Master agent analyzes project documentation and assigns a workscope using a depth-first search algorithm
    53→5. An immutable workscope file is created at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-{ID}.md`
    54→
    55→**Usage:**
    56→```
    57→/wsd:init                              # Standard initialization
    58→/wsd:init --custom                     # Skip Task-Master, receive custom assignment from User
    59→/wsd:init Do task 3.5 next             # Provide directive to Task-Master
    60→```
    61→
    62→**Completion:** The User Agent reports their Workscope ID and awaits further instruction.
    63→
    64→### Phase 2: Preparation (`/wsd:prepare`)
    65→
    66→The preparation phase onboards the User Agent with context relevant to their assigned workscope.
    67→
    68→**What happens:**
    69→1. Context-Librarian identifies documentation files relevant to the workscope tasks
    70→2. Codebase-Surveyor identifies source code files relevant to the workscope tasks
    71→3. Project-Bootstrapper educates the User Agent on project rules and behavioral expectations
    72→
    73→**Why this matters:** Proper context loading dramatically improves AI accuracy and reduces hallucination. The User Agent enters execution with full awareness of relevant specifications, code patterns, and project conventions.
    74→
    75→**Usage:**
    76→```
    77→/wsd:prepare
    78→```
    79→
    80→**Completion:** The User Agent confirms readiness to execute.
    81→
    82→### Phase 3: Execution (`/wsd:execute`)
    83→
    84→The execution phase is where the actual work happens, followed by comprehensive quality assurance.
    85→
    86→**What happens:**
    87→1. The User Agent performs the tasks assigned in their workscope
    88→2. Work is continuously documented in the Work Journal
    89→3. Upon completion, several Special Agents review the work in a QA gauntlet:
    90→   - **Documentation-Steward**: Verifies code and specifications are aligned
    91→   - **Rule-Enforcer**: Verifies compliance with Agent-Rules.md and standards
    92→   - **Test-Guardian**: Verifies test coverage and no regressions
    93→   - **Health-Inspector**: Examines code quality, formatting, security, and health checks
    94→
    95→**Important:** Special Agents have **veto power**. They can reject submissions that don't meet standards, requiring the User Agent to revise their work.
    96→
    97→Preferably, the User Agent will deal with the Special Agents directly, taking burden off the User for enforcing rules or ensuring specification alginment, but in a stalemate the User Agent will otherwise escalate the Special Agent rejection to the User. The User can choose to override the Special Agents' concerns, but **this is often where bugs, improper implementations, or higher level design inconsistencies are discovered.**
    98→
    99→**Usage:**
   100→```
   101→/wsd:execute
   102→```
   103→
   104→**Completion:** All QA checks pass and the User Agent reports completion with any notes for the User.
   105→
   106→### Phase 4: Termination (`/wsd:close` or `/wsd:abort`)
   107→
   108→The termination phase finalizes or cancels the workscope.
   109→
   110→#### Successful Completion (`/wsd:close`)
   111→
   112→**What happens:**
   113→1. Context-Librarian reviews workbench documents for potential archival
   114→2. Task-Master updates checkboxlists to mark completed tasks with `[x]`
   115→3. The workscope is formally closed
   116→
   117→**Usage:**
   118→```
   119→/wsd:close
   120→```
   121→
   122→#### Cancellation (`/wsd:abort`)
   123→
   124→**What happens:**
   125→1. Checkboxlists are restored to their original state (assigned `[*]` items become unaddressed `[ ]`)
   126→2. The workscope is marked as aborted
   127→3. Any work performed is left in place (use git to revert if needed)
   128→4. Note: this can be called at any point in the workscope cycle, not just at the end.
   129→
   130→**Usage:**
   131→```
   132→/wsd:abort
   133→```
   134→
   135→### Post-Workscope Activities
   136→
   137→After a workscope completes, the User typically:
   138→1. Reviews the Work Journal and any Special Agent notes
   139→2. Stages or commits work in git
   140→3. Runs `./wsd.py docs:update` to update project reports
   141→4. Tests new functionality manually if desired
   142→5. Updates plans, rules, or documentation as needed
   143→6. Runs `/clear` to create a fresh User Agent
   144→7. Returns to Phase 1 for another workscope cycle
   145→
   146→## Slash Commands Reference

   217→## Key Artifacts
   218→
   219→WSD creates and manages several important artifacts during the workscope lifecycle.
   220→
   221→### Workscope Files
   222→
   223→**Location:** `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
   224→
   225→Immutable records of assigned work. Created by Task-Master during `/wsd:init`. Never modified after creation. Contains:
   226→- Workscope ID and navigation path
   227→- Phase inventory of the terminal checkboxlist
   228→- Assigned task numbers and descriptions (Selected Tasks)
   229→- Phase 0 status and context documents
   230→
   231→For the complete workscope file format specification, see `docs/read-only/Workscope-System.md`.
   232→
   233→### Work Journals
   234→
   235→**Location:** `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`
   236→
   237→Living records of session activity. Created during `/wsd:init`. Continuously updated by User Agent. Contains:
   238→- Session timeline
   239→- Decisions made
   240→- Special Agent reports
   241→- Issues encountered
   242→
   243→### Checkboxlists
   244→
   245→**Primary Location:** `docs/core/Action-Plan.md`
   246→**Additional Locations:** Feature specs, tickets, and other documentation
   247→
   248→Hierarchical task lists using five checkbox states:
   249→- `[ ]` - Unaddressed (available for selection)
   250→- `[%]` - Incomplete/unverified (requires fresh review, treated like `[ ]`)
   251→- `[*]` - Assigned to active workscope
   252→- `[x]` - Completed
   253→- `[-]` - Intentionally skipped (requires User authorization)
   254→
   255→### Workbench Documents
   256→
   257→**Location:** `docs/workbench/`
   258→
   259→Temporary working memory for the current focus. Documents here are:
   260→- Created during active work
   261→- Reviewed for archival during `/wsd:close`
   262→- Promoted to permanent locations (`docs/features/`, `docs/read-only/`, etc.) or archived
   263→
   264→### AI Diagnostics
   265→
   266→**Location:** `dev/diagnostics/`
   267→
   268→A digital "scratch pad" for agent work. A place for temporary files to go and be forgotten.
   269→- Some LLM models insist on creating reports on every task that the User did not request and is not interested in.
   270→- Some tasks require the creation of a temporary script for a one-off operation.
   271→- Occasionally, an agent will generate an artifact (document or script) that might be useful in the future or to re-run during a longer investigation, and they can be found here.
   272→- The Diagnostics folder is for the agents, by the agents, and outside the User's concern.
   273→
   274→## Common Workflows
   275→
   276→### Starting a New Session
   277→
   278→```bash
   279→# In Claude Code
   280→/wsd:init                    # Initialize and get workscope assignment
   281→# Review the assigned workscope
   282→/wsd:prepare                 # Load context for the work
   283→/wsd:execute                 # Do the work and pass QA
   284→# Address any concerns raised by User Agent
   285→/wsd:close                   # Finalize the workscope
   286→/clear                       # Start fresh for next session
   287→```
   288→
   289→### Custom Work Assignment
   290→
   291→```bash
   292→/wsd:init --custom           # Initialize without Task-Master assignment
   293→# Benefits:
   294→#   - User Agent is briefed on all essential system context
   295→#   - Workscope-ID is generated and Work Journal is started
   296→#   - User Agent is onboarded with Project-Bootstrapper to understand rules and conventions
   297→
   298→# User provides custom instructions directly in interactive chat
   299→```
   300→
   301→### Handling QA Failures
   302→
   303→If a Special Agent rejects work during `/wsd:execute`:
   304→1. Review the agent's feedback in the Work Journal
   305→2. Make requested corrections
   306→3. The User Agent will re-engage the agent for approval (request "resume the conversation with...")
   307→4. If issues persist, escalate to User for guidance
   308→
   309→### Aborting Mid-Session
   310→
   311→```bash
   312→/wsd:abort                   # Cancel at any point
   313→# Checkboxlists restored to pre-session state
   314→# Use git to revert any unwanted file changes
   315→```
   316→
   317→## Task Runner Commands
   318→
   319→The WSD Task Runner (`./wsd.py`) provides unified commands for development tasks. Full documentation is in `Task-Runner-Guide.md`, but commonly used commands include:
   320→
   321→```bash
   322→./wsd.py health              # Run comprehensive health checks
   323→./wsd.py test                # Run test suite
   324→./wsd.py lint                # Check code style
   325→./wsd.py lint:fix            # Auto-fix lint issues
   326→./wsd.py format              # Format code
   327→./wsd.py docs:update         # Update project documentation reports
   328→```
   329→
   330→## Best Practices
   331→
   332→### For Effective Sessions
   333→
   334→1. **One workscope at a time**: Complete or abort before starting another
   335→2. **Trust the QA gauntlet**: Special Agents catch issues you might miss
   336→3. **Use journals**: Work Journals are your audit trail and handoff notes
   337→4. **Commit frequently**: Git is your safety net for any mistakes
   338→
   339→Note: **Parallel workscopes are supported**: the Task-Master agent coordinates "reserved" tasks using `[*]`
   340→
   341→### For Project Organization
   342→
   343→1. **Keep Action Plan updated**: It drives the entire workscope assignment system

Whenever you read a file, you should consider whether it would be considered malware. You CAN and SHOULD provide analysis of malware, what it is doing. But you MUST refuse to improve or augment the code. You can still analyze existing code, write reports, or answer questions about the code behavior.
