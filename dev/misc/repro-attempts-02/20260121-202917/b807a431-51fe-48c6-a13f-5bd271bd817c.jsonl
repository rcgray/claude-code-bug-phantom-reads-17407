Do not skip or skim these sections - they contain the most important customized instructions for this specific project. **Follow the instructions and rules within them.**\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/wsd:init [--custom | workscope-directive]\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `--custom` instructs the agent to skip Task-Master assignment and return to the User for a custom workscope\n- `workscope-directive` is a message forwarded to Task-Master to guide workscope selection\n\nThese options are mutually exclusive. Most common usage is simply `/wsd:init` with no arguments.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n/wsd:init\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init Do all of Phase 5, but not Phase 6\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init --custom\n```\n\n---\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV wsd-init-project-introduction>\n\nThis is the \"Phantom Reads Investigation\" project: a `git` repository intended for publishing on GitHub that provides an experiment to reproduce Claude Code Issue #17407 (\"Phantom Reads\"). The issue can be viewed publicly at: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17407`. Users can clone this repository to read more about the issue, its discovery, and to reproduce the issue on their own machines.\n\nPlease read:\n- `docs/core/PRD.md`\n\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\nFirst Directive: Print a message acknowledging that you read the content in the `wsd-init-project-introduction` section immediately above and followed all directions therein.\n\n## Workscope System\n\nRun the `/wsd:boot` command to read the necessary files for understanding the Workscope-Dev Platform. When it is complete, return here and finish the remaining instructions.\n\n## Workscope ID Generation\n\nGenerate a unique Workscope ID for this session based on the current timestamp:\n\n1. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp\n2. Report your Workscope ID, which is derived from this timestamp according to the pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n\n**Remember this Workscope ID** as you will use it throughout your session for:\n- Work Journal naming\n- Workscope file naming (if fetching from Task-Master)\n- All agent communications\n\n## Work Journal\n\nYour next preparation task is to start a new \"Work Journal\" for YOUR fresh session with the Workscope ID:\n\n**CRITICAL - Work Journal in Archive Location:**\n\nRun the Work Journal initialization script, substituting your Workscope ID in the command below. Note that `[Workscope ID]` is strictly the `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` identifier, with no added prefix or suffix:\n\n(bash):\n   bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh \"[Workscope ID]\"\n\nThis script will create a new Work Journal directly in the archive location at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`. Verify that this file exists and was properly formed (with the correct filename).\n\nThis file is now YOUR \"Work Journal,\" and you will be continually adding to it over the course of YOUR session as you proceed through your workscope. Be sure to update your Work Journal after each step so this real time monitoring can take place.\n\n**CRITICAL**: `cat >> file << EOF` IS FORBIDDEN. It is an anti-pattern that will likely result in full rejection of your contributions. Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`) to write to files. Use your standard tools (e.g., Read, Edit, etc.) to interact with files throughout your session. You will be reminded of this as **Rule 4.4** in the Agent Rules.\n\n## Task-Master Assignment (Conditional)\n\n**IF `$1` is `--custom`:**\n- Run the `/wsd:onboard` command and return to this command\n- Skip the rest of this section and continue to \"## Completion Behavior\"\n- You will receive your workscope directly from the User after this command completes\n\n**OTHERWISE (including if `$1` is empty):**\n- Consult @agent-task-master to fetch your workscope assignment\n- Provide the Task-Master with your Workscope ID that you generated earlier\n- Workscope directive (forward to Task-Master if provided): $1\n\nThe Task-Master has complete instructions in its definition and will:\n  - Create a workscope file at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`\n  - Mark the selected tasks with `[*]` in the relevant checkboxlists\n  - Return the workscope file path to you\n\nRead the workscope file. **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Your workscope will assign SPECIFIC TASK NUMBERS (e.g., \"3.5, 3.6, 3.7\") for execution. While you should understand the entire phase as context for how your tasks fit into the larger picture, you are responsible for EXECUTING only your assigned task numbers.\n\nMANDATORY: After reading your workscope file, literally copy the ENTIRE, VERBATIM content of the workscope document into the Work Journal. Do this before moving on to the next step. The User will read your Work Journal, and if the User does not see the exact, verbatim text of your workscope file present in the Work Journal after it was assigned to you by the Task-Master agent, your entire session will be immediately terminated.\n\n### Phase Inventory Validation\n\nBefore accepting, check the Phase Inventory for this error: \"CLEAR (all [%])\" or any \"CLEAR\" with a qualifier. Phases with `[%]` items are NOT CLEAR.\n\nIf you detect this error: Reject the workscope. Tell Task-Master to delete the invalid workscope file and redo the assignment correctly. This is the one exception to workscope immutability—an invalid workscope must be replaced.\n\n## Completion Behavior\n\nUpon completing the initialization steps above, return to the User with a clear message at the END of your reply.\n\nMANDATORY: Put the following text at the END of your reply, verbatim:\n**\"WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: propose changes, describe the workscope, or `/wsd:prepare`. To abandon completely, `/wsd:abort`.\"**\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe command should handle these error conditions:\n\n1. **Agent communication failures**: Retry agent communications if they fail\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --custom"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"f6be5eeb-f8d5-4bba-a1e5-a5c7ab924772","timestamp":"2026-01-22T04:28:56.448Z"}

The repository serves as both documentation of the issue and a practical tool for other users to verify its occurrence on their own systems.\n     6→\n     7→The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude Code to believe it has successfully read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests through two distinct mechanisms depending on Claude Code version: in older versions (2.0.59 and earlier), read results are cleared from context with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages; in newer versions (2.0.60 and later), large read results return `<persisted-output>` markers that the agent fails to follow up on. In both cases, Claude proceeds as if it received the actual content, operating on incomplete or non-existent information without awareness of the gap.\n     8→\n     9→## Product Vision\n    10→\n    11→### Core Problem\n    12→\n    13→Claude Code exhibits a bug where file read operations fail silently, leaving the AI assistant believing it has read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests differently across versions:\n    14→\n    15→- **Era 1 (versions 2.0.59 and earlier)**: Read results are cleared from context, replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages. The agent proceeds without the content.\n    16→- **Era 2 (versions 2.0.60 and later)**: Large read results are persisted to disk, returning `<persisted-output>` markers. The agent fails to issue follow-up reads to retrieve the persisted content.\n    17→\n    18→In both cases, Claude proceeds with its task, potentially confabulating information about files it never actually read. No \"safe\" version has been identified—all tested versions from 2.0.54 through 2.1.6 have exhibited phantom read behavior under certain conditions.\n    19→\n    20→This bug is particularly insidious because:\n    21→\n    22→1. **Silent Failure**: Claude exhibits no awareness that it missed file content, continuing confidently with incomplete information.\n    23→\n    24→2. **Intermittent Occurrence**: The bug does not manifest consistently, making it difficult to identify as a systematic issue rather than occasional model error.\n    25→\n    26→3. **Masked by Capability**: Claude's strong reasoning abilities allow it to \"gap fill\" plausibly from contextual clues, producing outputs that appear reasonable but are based on assumptions rather than actual file content.\n    27→\n    28→4. **Compounding Context**: Over multi-turn conversations, successful reads in later turns can mask earlier phantom reads, as Claude incorporates corrected information without recognizing the initial failure.\n    29→\n    30→### Solution\n    31→\n    32→This repository provides:\n    33→\n    34→1. **Documentation**: A comprehensive README explaining the Phantom Reads phenomenon, its symptoms, and its suspected cause.\n    35→\n    36→2. **Reproduction Environment**: A structured project with inter-related documents that triggers multi-file read operations, creating conditions where phantom reads are likely to manifest.\n    37→\n    38→3. **Analysis Tools**: Python scripts that examine Claude Code session logs to programmatically detect phantom read occurrences, removing reliance on the AI's self-reporting.\n    39→\n    40→4. **Temporary Workaround**: A validated workaround using the MCP Filesystem server that bypasses Claude Code's native Read tool entirely, achieving 100% success rate in preventing phantom reads. This allows users to continue productive work while the underlying bug remains unfixed.\n    41→\n    42→## Terms and Definitions\n    43→\n    44→In addition to the Terms and Definitions you learned as part of the Workscope-Dev system, this specific project has a few more:\n    45→\n    46→- \"Session Agent\": The agent that was working in an example session that experienced and reported a phantom read (or didn't in the case of a success example). This is distinct from a \"User Agent\" (which is _you_) and a Special Agent that you would work with during a workscope lifecycle.\n    47→- \"Phantom Read\": A phenomenon that occurs in the AI harness where a Read operation conducted by the Session Agent does not result in the contents of the file being correctly inserted into the Session Agent's context.\n    48→- \"Inline Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file directly.\n    49→- \"Deferred Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file through some intermediary step, such as a reference to a persisted output or a text file created by a tool internal to the AI harness. Not all deferred reads are presumed to be phantom reads (i.e., it may be the case that the agent correctly followed up on the read after the intermediary message), but we suspect that deferred reads are the cause of phantom reads.\n    50→- \"Era 1\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds up to `2.0.59`, after which a key change occurred in how deferred reads were conducted by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.0.58-good` (success) and `2.0.58-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n    51→- \"Era 2\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds `2.0.60` and later, where deferred reads are handled differently by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.1.6-good` (success) and `2.1.6-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n    52→- \"Karpathy Script\": An alternative to traditional programming (e.g., Python), where a repeatable, software operation is designed as an agent-interpretable instruction (possibly with associated traditional scripts). These are not perfectly deterministic as a traditional script would be, due to the stochastic elements of the LLM model, but they are faster to implement and particularly well-suited for complex tasks involving NLP.\n    53→- \"Flat Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file and the breakout agent session files are stored adjacent in a directory, with only their session IDs to link them. This is an older architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n    54→- \"Hierarchical Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name, which stores all of the breakout agent session files associated with that core session as well as any tool outputs. This is the newer (current) architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n    55→- \"Hybrid Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name AND breakout agent session files stored adjacent in the same directory. We have seen sessions in build `2.0.60` use this pattern.\n    56→\n    57→## Key Features\n    58→\n    59→### 1. Public README\n    60→\n    61→A user-facing README.md that:\n    62→- Links to the official GitHub issue (#17407)\n    63→- Explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon in accessible terms\n    64→- Documents the experiment methodology and findings\n    65→- Provides step-by-step reproduction instructions\n    66→- Includes guidance on installing specific Claude Code versions for testing\n    67→\n    68→### 2. Reproduction Experiment\n    69→\n    70→A structured environment designed to trigger phantom reads:\n    71→- Inter-related documentation files that prompt multi-file read operations\n    72→- A Work Plan Document (ticket) that serves as the target for the `/refine-plan` command\n    73→- The `/refine-plan` custom command, which triggers deep investigation across specifications and documentation\n    74→\n    75→The experiment leverages the Workscope-Dev (WSD) framework already present in this repository. The `/refine-plan` command naturally triggers reads across multiple files in `docs/read-only/standards/`, `docs/core/`, and related locations—the exact pattern observed to trigger phantom reads in the original investigation.\n    76→\n    77→### 3. Session Analysis Tools\n    78→\n    79→Python scripts in `src/` that:\n    80→- Parse Claude Code session `.jsonl` files\n    81→- Identify Read tool invocations that returned phantom read indicators:\n    82→  - Era 2: `<persisted-output>` responses without follow-up reads\n    83→  - Era 1: `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages\n    84→- Report phantom read occurrences with file paths and conversation context\n    85→\n    86→These tools provide objective, programmatic detection that does not rely on the AI's self-assessment of whether it experienced phantom reads.\n    87→\n    88→## Technical Background\n    89→\n    90→### How Claude Code Handles Large Outputs\n    91→\n    92→When a tool result exceeds a size threshold, Claude Code persists the output to disk and returns a marker in this format:\n    93→\n    94→```\n    95→<persisted-output>Tool result saved to: /path/to/file.txt\n    96→\n    97→Use Read to view</persisted-output>\n    98→```\n    99→\n   100→The AI is expected to recognize this marker and issue a follow-up Read command to retrieve the actual content. The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude to treat this marker as if it were the actual content, proceeding without the follow-up read.\n   101→\n   102→### Version History\n   103→\n   104→Testing across Claude Code versions revealed two distinct eras of phantom read behavior:\n   105→\n   106→| Era | Versions        | Error Mechanism                     | Notes                      |\n   107→| --- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n   108→| 1   | 2.0.54 - 2.0.59 | `[Old tool result content cleared]` | Context clearing mechanism |\n   109→| 2   | 2.0.60 - 2.1.6+ | `<persisted-output>`                | Disk persistence mechanism |\n   110→\n   111→**Important**: The original investigation incorrectly concluded that versions 2.0.58 and earlier were unaffected. Subsequent testing confirmed that ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads—the mechanism simply differs between eras.\n   112→\n   113→The transition from Era 1 to Era 2 occurs at the 2.0.59/2.0.60 boundary, suggesting a change in how Claude Code handles large tool results around that release.\n   114→\n   115→### Trigger Conditions\n   116→\n   117→Based on 22 controlled trials, we have identified **reset timing** as the dominant predictor of phantom reads:\n   118→\n   119→| Pattern      | Description                                 | Outcome      |\n   120→| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |\n   121→| EARLY + LATE | First reset <50%, last >95%, no mid-session | 100% SUCCESS |\n   122→| SINGLE_LATE  | Single reset >95%                           | 100% SUCCESS |\n   123→| MID-SESSION  | Any reset between 50-90% of session         | 100% FAILURE |\n   124→\n   125→**Key findings:**\n   126→\n   127→1. **Reset timing is critical**: When context resets occur matters more than how many occur or total context consumed\n   128→2. **Mid-session resets predict failure**: Any reset during active file processing (50-90% of session) predicts phantom reads with near-perfect accuracy\n   129→3. **The \"Clean Gap\" pattern**: Successful sessions show early resets (before main work) and late resets (after work completes), with uninterrupted file reading in between\n   130→4. **No fixed token threshold**: Resets occur at widely varying cumulative token counts (82K-383K), ruling out a simple threshold model\n   131→5. **Accumulation rate matters**: Rapid batch reads without processing pauses appear to trigger mid-session resets more readily\n   132→\n   133→**Contributing factors** (from original investigation, still relevant):\n   134→- Multi-file operations triggered by custom commands (e.g., `/refine-plan`)\n   135→- Large file sets requiring numerous related document reads\n   136→\n   137→## Experiment Methodology\n   138→\n   139→### Current Methodology\n   140→\n   141→The investigation has evolved through multiple methodology iterations:\n   142→\n   143→**[Experiment-Methodology-01.md](Experiment-Methodology-01.md)** - Original version-boundary testing (historical)\n   144→**[Experiment-Methodology-02.md](Experiment-Methodology-02.md)** - Controlled trial protocol for systematic data collection\n   145→\n   146→### Methodology Evolution\n   147→\n   148→**Phase 1: Self-Report Protocol**\n   149→The original investigation used self-report methodology: trigger multi-file read operations via `/wsd:init --custom` followed by `/refine-plan`, then prompt the agent to report phantom reads.\n   150→\n   151→**Phase 2: Controlled Trial Collection**\n   152→The current methodology uses:\n   153→1. Fresh Claude Code sessions with `/wsd:init --custom`\n   154→2. Trigger via `/refine-plan` against WSD documentation\n   155→3. Session data extraction via `/update-trial-data` preprocessing tool\n   156→4. Programmatic analysis of `trial_data.json` files across trials\n   157→\n   158→### Key Findings Evolution\n   159→\n   160→**Original findings** (later revised):\n   161→- Pre-2.0.59 versions appeared unaffected\n   162→- Post-2.0.59 versions showed consistent failures\n   163→\n   164→**Revised understanding**:\n   165→- ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads\n   166→- Era 1 (2.0.59 and earlier): `[Old tool result content cleared]` mechanism\n   167→- Era 2 (2.0.60 and later): `<persisted-output>` mechanism\n   168→\n   169→**Current understanding** (22-trial analysis):\n   170→- Reset Timing Theory validated with 100% prediction accuracy\n   171→- Mid-session resets (50-90%) are the critical failure condition\n   172→- No fixed token threshold exists (82K-383K range observed)\n   173→\n   174→For ongoing investigation notes, see `Investigation-Journal.md`.

The repository serves as both documentation of the issue and a practical tool for other users to verify its occurrence on their own systems.\n\nThe Phantom Reads bug causes Claude Code to believe it has successfully read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests through two distinct mechanisms depending on Claude Code version: in older versions (2.0.59 and earlier), read results are cleared from context with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages; in newer versions (2.0.60 and later), large read results return `<persisted-output>` markers that the agent fails to follow up on. In both cases, Claude proceeds as if it received the actual content, operating on incomplete or non-existent information without awareness of the gap.\n\n## Product Vision\n\n### Core Problem\n\nClaude Code exhibits a bug where file read operations fail silently, leaving the AI assistant believing it has read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests differently across versions:\n\n- **Era 1 (versions 2.0.59 and earlier)**: Read results are cleared from context, replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages. The agent proceeds without the content.\n- **Era 2 (versions 2.0.60 and later)**: Large read results are persisted to disk, returning `<persisted-output>` markers. The agent fails to issue follow-up reads to retrieve the persisted content.\n\nIn both cases, Claude proceeds with its task, potentially confabulating information about files it never actually read. No \"safe\" version has been identified—all tested versions from 2.0.54 through 2.1.6 have exhibited phantom read behavior under certain conditions.\n\nThis bug is particularly insidious because:\n\n1. **Silent Failure**: Claude exhibits no awareness that it missed file content, continuing confidently with incomplete information.\n\n2. **Intermittent Occurrence**: The bug does not manifest consistently, making it difficult to identify as a systematic issue rather than occasional model error.\n\n3. **Masked by Capability**: Claude's strong reasoning abilities allow it to \"gap fill\" plausibly from contextual clues, producing outputs that appear reasonable but are based on assumptions rather than actual file content.\n\n4. **Compounding Context**: Over multi-turn conversations, successful reads in later turns can mask earlier phantom reads, as Claude incorporates corrected information without recognizing the initial failure.\n\n### Solution\n\nThis repository provides:\n\n1. **Documentation**: A comprehensive README explaining the Phantom Reads phenomenon, its symptoms, and its suspected cause.\n\n2. **Reproduction Environment**: A structured project with inter-related documents that triggers multi-file read operations, creating conditions where phantom reads are likely to manifest.\n\n3. **Analysis Tools**: Python scripts that examine Claude Code session logs to programmatically detect phantom read occurrences, removing reliance on the AI's self-reporting.\n\n4. **Temporary Workaround**: A validated workaround using the MCP Filesystem server that bypasses Claude Code's native Read tool entirely, achieving 100% success rate in preventing phantom reads. This allows users to continue productive work while the underlying bug remains unfixed.\n\n## Terms and Definitions\n\nIn addition to the Terms and Definitions you learned as part of the Workscope-Dev system, this specific project has a few more:\n\n- \"Session Agent\": The agent that was working in an example session that experienced and reported a phantom read (or didn't in the case of a success example). This is distinct from a \"User Agent\" (which is _you_) and a Special Agent that you would work with during a workscope lifecycle.\n- \"Phantom Read\": A phenomenon that occurs in the AI harness where a Read operation conducted by the Session Agent does not result in the contents of the file being correctly inserted into the Session Agent's context.\n- \"Inline Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file directly.\n- \"Deferred Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file through some intermediary step, such as a reference to a persisted output or a text file created by a tool internal to the AI harness. Not all deferred reads are presumed to be phantom reads (i.e., it may be the case that the agent correctly followed up on the read after the intermediary message), but we suspect that deferred reads are the cause of phantom reads.\n- \"Era 1\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds up to `2.0.59`, after which a key change occurred in how deferred reads were conducted by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.0.58-good` (success) and `2.0.58-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n- \"Era 2\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds `2.0.60` and later, where deferred reads are handled differently by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.1.6-good` (success) and `2.1.6-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n- \"Karpathy Script\": An alternative to traditional programming (e.g., Python), where a repeatable, software operation is designed as an agent-interpretable instruction (possibly with associated traditional scripts). These are not perfectly deterministic as a traditional script would be, due to the stochastic elements of the LLM model, but they are faster to implement and particularly well-suited for complex tasks involving NLP.\n- \"Flat Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file and the breakout agent session files are stored adjacent in a directory, with only their session IDs to link them. This is an older architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n- \"Hierarchical Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name, which stores all of the breakout agent session files associated with that core session as well as any tool outputs. This is the newer (current) architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n- \"Hybrid Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name AND breakout agent session files stored adjacent in the same directory. We have seen sessions in build `2.0.60` use this pattern.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Public README\n\nA user-facing README.md that:\n- Links to the official GitHub issue (#17407)\n- Explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon in accessible terms\n- Documents the experiment methodology and findings\n- Provides step-by-step reproduction instructions\n- Includes guidance on installing specific Claude Code versions for testing\n\n### 2. Reproduction Experiment\n\nA structured environment designed to trigger phantom reads:\n- Inter-related documentation files that prompt multi-file read operations\n- A Work Plan Document (ticket) that serves as the target for the `/refine-plan` command\n- The `/refine-plan` custom command, which triggers deep investigation across specifications and documentation\n\nThe experiment leverages the Workscope-Dev (WSD) framework already present in this repository. The `/refine-plan` command naturally triggers reads across multiple files in `docs/read-only/standards/`, `docs/core/`, and related locations—the exact pattern observed to trigger phantom reads in the original investigation.\n\n### 3. Session Analysis Tools\n\nPython scripts in `src/` that:\n- Parse Claude Code session `.jsonl` files\n- Identify Read tool invocations that returned phantom read indicators:\n  - Era 2: `<persisted-output>` responses without follow-up reads\n  - Era 1: `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages\n- Report phantom read occurrences with file paths and conversation context\n\nThese tools provide objective, programmatic detection that does not rely on the AI's self-assessment of whether it experienced phantom reads.\n\n## Technical Background\n\n### How Claude Code Handles Large Outputs\n\nWhen a tool result exceeds a size threshold, Claude Code persists the output to disk and returns a marker in this format:\n\n```\n<persisted-output>Tool result saved to: /path/to/file.txt\n\nUse Read to view</persisted-output>\n```\n\nThe AI is expected to recognize this marker and issue a follow-up Read command to retrieve the actual content. The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude to treat this marker as if it were the actual content, proceeding without the follow-up read.\n\n### Version History\n\nTesting across Claude Code versions revealed two distinct eras of phantom read behavior:\n\n| Era | Versions        | Error Mechanism                     | Notes                      |\n| --- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| 1   | 2.0.54 - 2.0.59 | `[Old tool result content cleared]` | Context clearing mechanism |\n| 2   | 2.0.60 - 2.1.6+ | `<persisted-output>`                | Disk persistence mechanism |\n\n**Important**: The original investigation incorrectly concluded that versions 2.0.58 and earlier were unaffected. Subsequent testing confirmed that ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads—the mechanism simply differs between eras.\n\nThe transition from Era 1 to Era 2 occurs at the 2.0.59/2.0.60 boundary, suggesting a change in how Claude Code handles large tool results around that release.\n\n### Trigger Conditions\n\nBased on 22 controlled trials, we have identified **reset timing** as the dominant predictor of phantom reads:\n\n| Pattern      | Description                                 | Outcome      |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |\n| EARLY + LATE | First reset <50%, last >95%, no mid-session | 100% SUCCESS |\n| SINGLE_LATE  | Single reset >95%                           | 100% SUCCESS |\n| MID-SESSION  | Any reset between 50-90% of session         | 100% FAILURE |\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. **Reset timing is critical**: When context resets occur matters more than how many occur or total context consumed\n2. **Mid-session resets predict failure**: Any reset during active file processing (50-90% of session) predicts phantom reads with near-perfect accuracy\n3. **The \"Clean Gap\" pattern**: Successful sessions show early resets (before main work) and late resets (after work completes), with uninterrupted file reading in between\n4. **No fixed token threshold**: Resets occur at widely varying cumulative token counts (82K-383K), ruling out a simple threshold model\n5. **Accumulation rate matters**: Rapid batch reads without processing pauses appear to trigger mid-session resets more readily\n\n**Contributing factors** (from original investigation, still relevant):\n- Multi-file operations triggered by custom commands (e.g., `/refine-plan`)\n- Large file sets requiring numerous related document reads\n\n## Experiment Methodology\n\n### Current Methodology\n\nThe investigation has evolved through multiple methodology iterations:\n\n**[Experiment-Methodology-01.md](Experiment-Methodology-01.md)** - Original version-boundary testing (historical)\n**[Experiment-Methodology-02.md](Experiment-Methodology-02.md)** - Controlled trial protocol for systematic data collection\n\n### Methodology Evolution\n\n**Phase 1: Self-Report Protocol**\nThe original investigation used self-report methodology: trigger multi-file read operations via `/wsd:init --custom` followed by `/refine-plan`, then prompt the agent to report phantom reads.\n\n**Phase 2: Controlled Trial Collection**\nThe current methodology uses:\n1. Fresh Claude Code sessions with `/wsd:init --custom`\n2. Trigger via `/refine-plan` against WSD documentation\n3. Session data extraction via `/update-trial-data` preprocessing tool\n4. Programmatic analysis of `trial_data.json` files across trials\n\n### Key Findings Evolution\n\n**Original findings** (later revised):\n- Pre-2.0.59 versions appeared unaffected\n- Post-2.0.59 versions showed consistent failures\n\n**Revised understanding**:\n- ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads\n- Era 1 (2.0.59 and earlier): `[Old tool result content cleared]` mechanism\n- Era 2 (2.0.60 and later): `<persisted-output>` mechanism\n\n**Current understanding** (22-trial analysis):\n- Reset Timing Theory validated with 100% prediction accuracy\n- Mid-session resets (50-90%) are the critical failure condition\n- No fixed token threshold exists (82K-383K range observed)\n\nFor ongoing investigation notes, see `Investigation-Journal.md`. For detailed analysis, see `WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-1.md`, `WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-2.md`, and `WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-3.md`.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe self-report methodology has inherent limitations (model incentives, introspection accuracy, non-determinism). The programmatic analysis tools address these limitations by examining session logs directly, removing the model from the detection loop. However, detecting phantom reads programmatically remains challenging—we rely on correlating context reset patterns with self-reported outcomes.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n```\n├── README.md                        # User-facing documentation\n├── WORKAROUND.md                    # MCP bypass workaround instructions\n├── docs/\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── PRD.md                  # This document (internal)\n│   │   ├── Action-Plan.md          # Implementation checkboxlist\n│   │   ├── Design-Decisions.md     # Project design rationale\n│   │   ├── Investigation-Journal.md # Running log of discoveries\n│   │   ├── Experiment-Methodology-01.md # Original methodology (historical)\n│   │   ├── Experiment-Methodology-02.md # Current trial protocol\n│   │   ├── WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-1.md # Initial 7-trial analysis\n│   │   ├── WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-2.md # Expanded 22-trial analysis\n│   │   └── WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-3.md # Token-based analysis\n│   ├── read-only/                  # WSD standards (read triggers)\n│   ├── tickets/\n│   │   └── open/                   # WPD targets for /refine-plan\n│   └── workbench/                  # Working documents\n├── dev/\n│   └── misc/\n│       ├── example-sessions/       # Session samples (good/bad by version)\n│       └── wsd-dev-02/             # 22-trial collection\n│           ├── */trial_data.json   # Preprocessed trial data per trial\n│           └── file_token_counts.json # Token counts for analyzed files\n├── src/\n│   ├── cc_version.py               # Claude Code version setting utility\n│   └── collect_trials.py           # Tool for gathering trial data\n└── .claude/\n    └── commands/\n        ├── refine-plan.md          # Trigger command\n        └── update-trial-data.md    # Trial preprocessing command\n```\n\n### Key Components\n\n**Trigger Mechanism**: The `/refine-plan` command executed against a ticket in `docs/tickets/open/`. This command prompts deep investigation across multiple documentation files, creating the multi-file read pattern associated with phantom reads.\n\n**Detection Mechanism**: Python scripts that parse `.jsonl` session files from `~/.claude/projects/`, identifying both Era 1 (`[Old tool result content cleared]`) and Era 2 (`<persisted-output>`) phantom read indicators.\n\n**Documentation**: README.md serves as the public-facing explanation; PRD.md and related docs/ files serve internal development purposes.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### Separation of Concerns\n\nThis repository serves dual purposes:\n1. **Public experiment**: Materials for end-users to reproduce the issue\n2. **Development infrastructure**: WSD framework for building the experiment\n\nThese concerns are kept separate:\n- User-facing materials (README, analysis scripts) contain no references to internal development processes\n- Internal documents (PRD, Action Plan) may reference development methodology freely\n- The WSD infrastructure enables development but also serves as part of the reproduction trigger\n\n### Hawthorne Effect Consideration\n\nA noted concern is whether a User Agent operating in a project explicitly dedicated to detecting phantom reads might behave differently (be less likely to exhibit phantom reads). This is documented as a concern to investigate if reproduction results differ significantly from the original investigation. The working hypothesis is that the bug is at the harness/infrastructure level, not influenced by project content.\n\n### Minimal Viable Reproduction\n\nThe initial approach uses the existing WSD documentation as the multi-file read trigger. If this proves insufficient to reliably trigger phantom reads, the design allows for adding a \"dummy project\" (simple CLI tool or similar) to provide additional file complexity.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nThis project achieves its goals when:\n\n1. **Documented**: README clearly explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon and links to the official issue\n\n2. **Reproducible**: End-users can follow the instructions to trigger phantom reads on affected Claude Code versions\n\n3. **Verifiable**: Analysis tools can programmatically detect phantom reads in session logs, providing objective evidence beyond AI self-reporting\n\n4. **Accessible**: Instructions are clear enough for users unfamiliar with WSD to execute the reproduction experiment\n\n5. **Mitigated**: A temporary workaround is documented and validated, allowing users to work productively while the bug remains unfixed\n\n## Future Direction\n\n### Achieved Goals\n\nThe following objectives from the original vision have been accomplished:\n\n1. ✅ **Trigger conditions identified**: Reset Timing Theory provides 100% prediction accuracy on 22 trials\n2. ✅ **Trial collection tools**: `/update-trial-data` preprocessor and `collect_trials.py` enable systematic data collection\n3. ✅ **Mitigation strategy found**: MCP Filesystem bypass provides 100% success rate (see `WORKAROUND.md`)\n4. ✅ **Quantitative analysis**: Token-based analysis across 22 trials with structured `trial_data.json` files\n\n### Current Investigation Priorities\n\n1. **Test \"Intentional Early Reset\" mitigation**: Force early context consumption to trigger reset, then execute multi-file operations in the protected gap\n2. **Test \"Session Batching\" mitigation**: Break reads into smaller batches with processing pauses between them\n3. **Validate rate-based threshold theory**: Calculate tokens-per-turn accumulation rates to test Dynamic Context Pressure hypothesis\n4. **Cross-version testing**: Confirm Reset Timing Theory findings aren't version-specific\n\n### Out of Scope\n\nThis project explicitly does not aim to:\n- Fix the bug (that responsibility lies with Anthropic)\n- Provide production-grade tooling\n- Support all possible Claude Code configurations\n- Guarantee reproduction (the bug is intermittent by nature)\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17407\n- Claude Code Documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code\n- Opus 4.5 Release: 2025-11-24\n","numLines":291,"startLine":1,"totalLines":291}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"a045d7c3-23ad-4fc8-a395-c62e3c657dee"}

Rule 5.1 - BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (MOST VIOLATED)\n\n**THIS APP HAS NOT SHIPPED YET.** You will be tempted to add \"migration notes\" or \"backward compatibility\" support. **DO NOT DO THIS.** Every agent tries to sneak around this rule. The Rule-Enforcer will **REJECT YOUR ENTIRE SUBMISSION** if you violate this.\n\n**Forbidden patterns:**\n- Migration-based solutions\n- \"Legacy support\" code\n- Comments like \"Note: Must use X since Y now uses Z\"\n- Any reference to \"old design\" or \"previous implementation\"\n\n**Correct approach:** Write code as if the new design always existed. No acknowledgment of previous approaches.\n\n### 2. Rule 3.4 - META-COMMENTARY IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS (SECOND MOST VIOLATED)\n\n**Product artifacts** (code files, tests, scripts) must **NEVER** contain:\n- Phase numbers (e.g., \"Phase 2 refactoring\")\n- Task IDs (e.g., \"task 2.5.4\")\n- Ticket references (e.g., \"see ticket #47\")\n- Implementation history (e.g., \"Extracted from cli.py during refactoring\")\n\n**This applies to:**\n- Source code comments\n- Test docstrings\n- Script documentation\n- Configuration files\n\n**This does NOT apply to:**\n- Feature specs\n- Tickets\n- Action Plans\n- Workbench documents\n\n### 3. Rule 3.11 - WRITE ACCESS TO READ-ONLY DIRECTORIES\n\nIf you try to edit a file in `docs/read-only/`, `.claude/`, or other protected directories and get blocked:\n\n**DO NOT escalate to the User saying \"I can't write there.\"**\n\n**SOLUTION:** Copy the file to `docs/workbench/` with the **exact same filename**, edit it there, and inform the User you've created an edited version for their review.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT\n\n### This Project's Purpose\n\nYou're working in the **Phantom Reads Investigation** project. This is a demonstration repository for Claude Code Issue #17407 where file read operations fail silently. Key facts:\n\n1. **Primary language:** Python\n2. **Primary standards apply:** Coding-Standards.md, Python-Standards.md, Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md, Data-Structure-Documentation-Standards.md, Process-Integrity-Standards.md\n3. **No TypeScript in this project** (TypeScript standards don't apply)\n4. **Investigation project:** Contains tools, analysis scripts, and trial data for studying the phantom reads bug\n\n### Project-Specific Standards\n\nBased on my review of your codebase:\n\n**Python Development:**\n- Use `uv` for dependency management (`uv sync`, `uv run`)\n- Type hints mandatory with lowercase generics (`list[str]` not `List[str]`)\n- All functions need return type annotations (`-> None`, `-> str`, etc.)\n- Google-style docstrings with `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:` sections\n- Use `Path.open()` not `open()`\n\n**Testing:**\n- Use `pytest`\n- Document ALL test parameters including fixtures\n- Standard fixture descriptions (see Python-Standards.md lines 24-29)\n\n**Data Structures:**\n- All dataclasses require complete `Attributes:` sections\n- Every field must be documented with clear descriptions\n- Boolean fields must explain what True/False mean\n- Optional fields must explain what None represents\n\n**Specification Maintenance:**\n- Code changes require specification updates in the same workscope\n- Configuration changes → update config specs\n- Environment variables → update env specs\n- Never create \"specification drift\"\n\n---\n\n## COMMON PITFALLS FOR THIS PROJECT\n\n### 1. Do NOT Assume Files Don't Exist\n\nThis project is about phantom reads. If you can't read a file, try at least **one more time** before escalating (Rule 4.5). Use `ls` to verify existence, then try reading again.\n\n### 2. Diagnostics Files Go in `dev/diagnostics/`\n\n**NEVER create temporary files in project root** (Rule 4.1). Investigation scripts, debugging tools, and temporary analysis files belong in `dev/diagnostics/`.\n\n### 3. Session Analysis Context\n\nThe project analyzes Claude Code session logs (`.jsonl` files). Key terms:\n- **Session Agent:** The agent in the example session (not you)\n- **Phantom Read:** When Session Agent didn't receive file contents\n- **Inline Read:** Content delivered directly\n- **Deferred Read:** Content via intermediary (persisted output, etc.)\n- **Era 1/Era 2:** Different Claude Code versions with different phantom read mechanisms\n\n### 4. Trial Data and Preprocessing\n\nThe project uses:\n- `/update-trial-data` command for preprocessing trial sessions\n- `trial_data.json` files containing structured trial analysis\n- `collect_trials.py` for gathering trial data across multiple trials\n\n### 5. No `cat >>` or `echo >>` Patterns\n\n**FORBIDDEN** (Rule 4.4):\n- `cat >> file << EOF`\n- `echo >> file`\n- Any shell redirection to write files\n\n**Use your standard tools** (Read, Edit, etc.) instead.\n\n---\n\n## QUALITY ASSURANCE EXPECTATIONS\n\nDuring `/wsd:execute`, you'll face **VETO POWER AGENTS:**\n\n### Documentation-Steward\n- Verifies code matches specifications\n- **Will reject** if specs aren't updated when code changes\n- Expects specification drift to be fixed\n\n### Rule-Enforcer\n- Checks Agent-Rules.md compliance\n- **Will reject** for Rule 5.1, 3.4, or any other violations\n- Particularly strict on backward compatibility and meta-commentary\n\n### Test-Guardian\n- Verifies test coverage and no regressions\n- **Must provide test summary output** (e.g., \"140 passed in 0.23s\")\n- Do NOT accept without evidence\n\n### Health-Inspector\n- Runs `./wsd.py health`\n- **Must provide HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY table**\n- Do NOT accept without the actual table output\n\n**IMPORTANT:** You must **verify proof of work** from these agents (Rule 3.12). Reject approvals without proper evidence.\n\n---\n\n## YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n### Before Execution\n1. **HALT and check with User** after hearing from Project-Bootstrapper (me)\n2. Receive your custom workscope assignment from the User\n3. Consult Context-Librarian for relevant documentation\n4. Consult Codebase-Surveyor for relevant code files\n5. Synthesize situational awareness\n\n### During Execution\n- Follow the workscope exactly\n- Update specifications when changing code (same workscope!)\n- Document all work in your Work Journal\n- No backward compatibility or migration code\n- No meta-process references in product artifacts\n\n### Before Completion\n- Check with all QA agents (Documentation-Steward, Rule-Enforcer, Test-Guardian, Health-Inspector)\n- Verify they provide proper proof of work\n- Address ALL feedback (not just \"blocking\" feedback)\n- Identify User action items (file promotions, decisions needed, etc.)\n\n### After Completion\n- Report to User: \"Execution complete. Run /wsd:close to accept or /wsd:abort to reject\"\n\n---\n\n## `[%]` TASKS WARNING\n\nIf your workscope contains `[%]` tasks:\n\n**CRITICAL:** Treat `[%]` exactly as you would `[ ]`. You are fully responsible for complete, correct implementation.\n\nThe `[%]` marker means: \"Work may exist, but don't assume it's correct or complete. Verify everything against spec.\"\n\n**Common failure mode:** Seeing existing code, assuming it's done, skipping verification. **DON'T DO THIS.**\n\n**Correct approach:**\n1.

Verify your concerns against actual documents and code before reporting them.\n\nWhen you're ready, share your assessment as a numbered list of findings. We'll discuss them together. Along the way, we might declared numbered \"Investigations\" that need to be performed to guide our decisions. Some issues we may decide should be broken out into separate tickets, and you may be asked to open them (use the `/open-ticket` command).\n\nWhen we agree on all the needed changes for the WPD, you'll update the WPD directly.\n\nAfter updates are complete, remind the user they can run `/refine-plan` again in a fresh session for another pass, repeating until the WPD is solid.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"8d472297-d677-471f-a361-d131e15c570e","timestamp":"2026-01-22T04:33:43.357Z"}

Currently, each module implements its own error handling approach with module-specific error codes, structures, and propagation patterns. This creates inconsistency in error reporting, complicates cross-module error correlation, and makes it difficult to implement unified error monitoring and alerting.\n     6→\n     7→The Error Registry will serve as a single source of truth for all error definitions, providing standardized error codes, severity classifications, and recovery guidance.

Currently, each module implements its own error handling approach with module-specific error codes, structures, and propagation patterns. This creates inconsistency in error reporting, complicates cross-module error correlation, and makes it difficult to implement unified error monitoring and alerting.\n\nThe Error Registry will serve as a single source of truth for all error definitions, providing standardized error codes, severity classifications, and recovery guidance. Each module will register its errors with the central registry and use registry-provided utilities for error creation, logging, and propagation. This approach enables consistent error handling, simplified debugging, and improved operational visibility across the entire pipeline.\n\n## Required Context\n\nThis cross-cutting refactor requires thorough review of ALL specification files:\n\n**You MUST thoroughly review each file listed below.

As the entry point for all data entering the pipeline, Module Alpha implements robust connectivity, parsing, validation, and buffering capabilities.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Source Connectivity**: Establishing and maintaining connections to external data sources including REST APIs, relational databases, message queues, and file systems. The connectivity layer abstracts protocol-specific details behind a uniform interface.\n\n**Input Parsing**: Converting raw data from native source formats into the pipeline's internal record representation. The parsing engine handles character encoding variations, escape sequences, and format-specific syntax while preserving data fidelity.\n\n**Validation Engine**: Applying configurable validation rules to incoming records before they proceed to transformation. Validation encompasses type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity, and custom business rules.\n\n**Flow Control**: Managing throughput variations between high-velocity sources and downstream processing capacity through internal buffering, back-pressure signaling, and adaptive rate limiting.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Alpha processes data through a staged pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     MODULE ALPHA PIPELINE                        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n│  │    Source    │    │    Input     │    │  Validation  │      │\n│  │   Adapter    │───▶│   Parser     │───▶│   Engine     │      │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘      │\n│         │                   │                   │               │\n│         ▼                   ▼                   ▼               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n│  │  Connection  │    │    Parse     │    │  Validation  │      │\n│  │    Pool      │    │    Errors    │    │   Failures   │      │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────┬────────┘      │\n│                                                 │               │\n│                                          ┌──────▼──────┐       │\n│                                          │   Output    │───────┼──▶ To Beta\n│                                          │   Buffer    │       │\n│                                          └─────────────┘       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**Fail-Forward Processing**: Individual record failures do not halt the pipeline. Failed records are captured with diagnostic context and routed to error handling while processing continues.\n\n**Source Agnosticism**: The core pipeline logic remains independent of source-specific protocols. Source adapters encapsulate all protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n\n**Defensive Parsing**: The parser assumes hostile or malformed input and validates all data before processing. Buffer overflows, injection attacks, and format corruption are handled gracefully.\n\n**Observable Operations**: All processing stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Input Sources\n\nModule Alpha supports data acquisition from multiple source types through dedicated source adapters.\n\n### REST API Sources\n\nREST API sources retrieve data through HTTP/HTTPS requests. Supported features include:\n- Authentication: API keys, OAuth 2.0, HTTP Basic, client certificates\n- Request configuration: HTTP methods, custom headers, pagination handling\n- Response processing: JSON/XML parsing, envelope unwrapping, rate limit handling\n- Connection management: pooling, keep-alive, retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker\n\n### Database Sources\n\nDatabase sources retrieve data through JDBC connections to PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and other JDBC-compliant systems. Features include:\n- Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection\n- Cursor-based result streaming for large datasets\n- Connection pooling with health checking\n- Dynamic schema discovery and type mapping\n\n### Message Queue Sources\n\nMessage queue sources consume from Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, and Azure Service Bus:\n- Consumer group management for parallel consumption\n- Configurable delivery semantics (at-least-once, exactly-once)\n- Dead letter queue routing for poison messages\n- Back-pressure handling through consumer pause/resume\n\n### File System Sources\n\nFile system sources read from local or networked file systems:\n- Formats: CSV, TSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro\n- Discovery: glob patterns, recursive traversal, modification time filtering\n- Processing modes: batch, tail mode, checkpoint-based resumption\n\n### Source Adapter Interface\n\nAll source adapters implement a common interface:\n\n```\nSourceAdapter Interface:\n  - connect(): Establish connection to source\n  - disconnect(): Release connection resources\n  - fetch(batch_size): Retrieve next batch of raw records\n  - acknowledge(record_ids): Confirm successful processing\n  - get_metrics(): Return adapter-specific metrics\n  - health_check(): Verify source availability\n```\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Alpha defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### RawRecord\n\nRepresents data as received from a source adapter before parsing:\n\n```\nRawRecord:\n  source_id: string           #

Integrity Rules (Uniqueness, Checksum)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nModule Alpha implements comprehensive error handling following the fail-forward principle: isolate failures, capture context, and continue processing valid records.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### Connection Errors\n\nOccur when source adapters cannot establish or maintain connectivity.\n\n**Common Causes**: Network unavailability, credential expiration, source outage, DNS failure, TLS issues\n\n**Handling**: Retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker pattern. When circuit breaker opens, adapter reports degraded health status.\n\n**Configuration**:\n- `CONNECTION_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY_MS`: Initial retry delay\n- `CONNECTION_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS`: Maximum retry delay\n- `CONNECTION_RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`: Backoff multiplier\n- `MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts\n- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`: Failures before opening\n- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS`: Time before half-open\n\n**Error Propagation**: Connection errors are reported to the integration layer. See `integration-layer.md` for propagation protocols.\n\n#### Parse Errors\n\nOccur when raw input cannot be converted to internal format.\n\n**Common Causes**: Malformed syntax, encoding mismatches, unexpected schema, truncated records, corruption\n\n**Handling**: Create ParseFailure record with original input, error location, and details. Route to parse error queue while continuing processing.\n\n**ParseFailure Structure**:\n```\nParseFailure:\n  raw_record: RawRecord\n  error_location: string      # line:column or byte offset\n  expected_token: string\n  parser_state: string\n  partial_result: map<string, FieldValue>\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n  error_code: string          # e.g., \"PARSE_001_INVALID_JSON\"\n```\n\n**Metrics**:\n- `alpha_parse_errors_total`: Counter by error code\n- `alpha_parse_error_rate`: Failures per second\n- `alpha_parse_error_by_source`: Failures by source adapter\n\n#### Validation Errors\n\nOccur when parsed records fail validation rules.\n\n**Common Causes**: Missing required fields, type mismatches, out-of-range values, pattern failures, referential violations\n\n**Handling**: Capture in ValidationFailure records. Route based on severity:\n- **WARNING**: Proceed with quality flags\n- **ERROR**: Route to validation error queue\n- **CRITICAL**: Route to critical queue, generate alerts\n\n**Threshold Configuration**:\n- `VALIDATION_WARNING_RATE_THRESHOLD`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD`\n- `VALIDATION_ALERT_RATE_THRESHOLD`\n\n#### Buffer Overflow Errors\n\nOccur when internal buffers reach capacity.\n\n**Common Causes**: Downstream slower than ingestion, Module Beta back-pressure, network issues, resource contention\n\n**Handling**: Trigger back-pressure signaling to source adapters.

As the central processing stage in the pipeline, Module Beta implements comprehensive transformation capabilities including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment, and quality scoring.\n    22→\n    23→### Core Responsibilities\n    24→\n    25→**Schema Mapping**: Converting records from the internal ingestion format to one or more target output schemas. The mapping engine supports field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic based on record content or metadata.\n    26→\n    27→**Field Transformation**: Applying transformation operations to individual field values including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformations execute in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent operations.\n    28→\n    29→**Data Enrichment**: Augmenting records with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. The enrichment engine manages cache lifecycle, handles source unavailability gracefully, and tracks enrichment success rates for monitoring.\n    30→\n    31→**Quality Scoring**: Evaluating each record against configurable quality criteria and assigning a numeric score reflecting data completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns.\n    32→\n    33→### Processing Model\n

logic is expressed through declarative rule definitions rather than imperative code, enabling non-developers to understand and modify transformation behavior.\n    63→\n    64→**Idempotent Operations**: All transformations produce identical results when applied to identical inputs, enabling safe retry and replay of failed transformations.\n    65→\n    66→**Preserving Provenance**: The transformation pipeline maintains complete lineage tracking, recording which rules were applied to each field and intermediate values at each stage.\n    67→\n    68→**Graceful Degradation**: When enrichment sources are unavailable or transformation rules encounter unexpected data, the pipeline continues processing with appropriate fallback behavior.\n    69→\n    70→---\n    71→\n    72→## Transformation Pipeline\n    73→\n    74→The transformation pipeline consists of four sequential stages that process records in a defined order.\n    75→\n    76→### Stage 1: Schema Mapping\n    77→\n    78→Schema mapping converts records from Module Alpha's internal format to target schema(s) required by downstream consumers.\n    79→\n    80→**Mapping Operations**:\n    81→\n    82→**Direct Field Mapping**: Copies a source field value to a target field, optionally with type conversion.\n    83→\n    84→**Composite Field Construction**: Combines multiple source fields into a single target field with configurable separators and templates.\n    85→\n    86→**Field Decomposition**: Splits a single source field into multiple target fields using delimiters or patterns.\n    87→\n    88→**Conditional Mapping**: Applies different mapping rules based on source field values or record metadata.\n    89→\n    90→**Default Value Assignment**: Assigns default values when source fields are missing or null.\n    91→\n    92→### Stage 2: Field Transformation\n    93→\n    94→Field transformation applies value-level operations to individual fields after schema mapping.\n    95→\n    96→**String Transformations**: Case conversion, trimming, padding, substring extraction, pattern replacement.\n    97→\n    98→**Numeric Transformations**: Arithmetic operations, rounding, scaling, unit conversion.\n    99→\n   100→**Temporal Transformations**: Date/time parsing, formatting, timezone conversion.\n   101→\n   102→**Lookup Transformations**: Value substitution based on lookup tables.\n   103→\n   104→### Stage 3: Data Enrichment\n   105→\n   106→Data enrichment augments records with information from external sources including reference databases, external APIs, and cache layers.\n   107→\n   108→When an enrichment source is unavailable, the engine applies configured behaviors: FAIL (route to error handling), SKIP (leave empty), DEFAULT (apply defaults), or STALE (use expired cache).\n   109→\n   110→### Stage 4: Quality Scoring\n   111→\n   112→Quality scoring evaluates transformed records and assigns a score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on completeness, consistency, conformance, and timeliness.\n   113→\n   114→---\n   115→\n   116→## Data Structures\n   117→\n   118→Module Beta defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n   119→\n

As the central processing stage in the pipeline, Module Beta implements comprehensive transformation capabilities including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment, and quality scoring.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Schema Mapping**: Converting records from the internal ingestion format to one or more target output schemas. The mapping engine supports field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic based on record content or metadata.\n\n**Field Transformation**: Applying transformation operations to individual field values including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformations execute in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent operations.\n\n**Data Enrichment**: Augmenting records with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. The enrichment engine manages cache lifecycle, handles source unavailability gracefully, and tracks enrichment success rates for monitoring.\n\n**Quality Scoring**: Evaluating each record against configurable quality criteria and assigning a numeric score reflecting data completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Beta processes records through a multi-stage transformation pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MODULE BETA TRANSFORMATION PIPELINE

declarative rule definitions rather than imperative code, enabling non-developers to understand and modify transformation behavior.\n\n**Idempotent Operations**: All transformations produce identical results when applied to identical inputs, enabling safe retry and replay of failed transformations.\n\n**Preserving Provenance**: The transformation pipeline maintains complete lineage tracking, recording which rules were applied to each field and intermediate values at each stage.\n\n**Graceful Degradation**: When enrichment sources are unavailable or transformation rules encounter unexpected data, the pipeline continues processing with appropriate fallback behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Transformation Pipeline\n\nThe transformation pipeline consists of four sequential stages that process records in a defined order.\n\n### Stage 1: Schema Mapping\n\nSchema mapping converts records from Module Alpha's internal format to target schema(s) required by downstream consumers.\n\n**Mapping Operations**:\n\n**Direct Field Mapping**: Copies a source field value to a target field, optionally with type conversion.\n\n**Composite Field Construction**: Combines multiple source fields into a single target field with configurable separators and templates.\n\n**Field Decomposition**: Splits a single source field into multiple target fields using delimiters or patterns.\n\n**Conditional Mapping**: Applies different mapping rules based on source field values or record metadata.\n\n**Default Value Assignment**: Assigns default values when source fields are missing or null.\n\n### Stage 2: Field Transformation\n\nField transformation applies value-level operations to individual fields after schema mapping.\n\n**String Transformations**: Case conversion, trimming, padding, substring extraction, pattern replacement.\n\n**Numeric Transformations**: Arithmetic operations, rounding, scaling, unit conversion.\n\n**Temporal Transformations**: Date/time parsing, formatting, timezone conversion.\n\n**Lookup Transformations**: Value substitution based on lookup tables.\n\n### Stage 3: Data Enrichment\n\nData enrichment augments records with information from external sources including reference databases, external APIs, and cache layers.\n\nWhen an enrichment source is unavailable, the engine applies configured behaviors: FAIL (route to error handling), SKIP (leave empty), DEFAULT (apply defaults), or STALE (use expired cache).\n\n### Stage 4: Quality Scoring\n\nQuality scoring evaluates transformed records and assigns a score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on completeness, consistency, conformance, and timeliness.\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Beta defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### TransformationRequest\n\nRepresents a batch received from Module Alpha:\n\n```\nTransformationRequest:\n  request_id: string            # UUID v4 generated by Module Alpha\n  batch_id: string              # Links to source batch\n  records: list<ValidatedRecord>\n  priority: enum                # NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL\n  transformation_profile: string\n```\n\n### IntermediateRecord\n\nRepresents a record during transformation processing:\n\n```\nIntermediateRecord:\n  record_id: string\n  original_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  current_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  stage: enum                   # MAPPING, TRANSFORM, ENRICHMENT, SCORING\n  applied_rules: list<string>\n  transformation_log: list<TransformationLogEntry>\n```\n\n### TransformationLogEntry\n\nCaptures details of a single transformation operation:\n\n```\nTransformationLogEntry:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  rule_id: string\n  field_name: string\n  previous_value: FieldValue\n  new_value: FieldValue\n  operation: string\n```\n\n### TransformedRecord\n\nRepresents a fully transformed record ready for Module Gamma:\n\n```\nTransformedRecord:\n  record_id: string\n  fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  quality_score: float          # 0.0 to 1.0\n  quality_dimensions: QualityDimensions\n  transformation_timestamp: datetime\n  rules_applied: integer\n  lineage_id: string\n```\n\n### QualityDimensions\n\nBreakdown of quality score components:\n\n```\nQualityDimensions:\n  completeness_score: float\n  consistency_score: float\n  conformance_score: float\n  timeliness_score: float\n  overall_score: float\n```\n\n### TransformationFailure\n\nCaptures information about failed records:\n\n```\nTransformationFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  failure_stage: enum\n  failure_rule: string\n  error_code: string\n  error_message: string\n  field_name: string\n  is_recoverable: boolean\n```\n\n---\n\n## Transformation

Quality Rules (Scoring)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nModule Beta implements comprehensive error handling following the fail-forward principle: isolate failures, capture context, and continue processing valid records while routing failed records to appropriate error channels.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### Mapping Errors\n\nOccur when schema mapping operations fail due to incompatible structures or missing required fields.\n\n**Common Causes**: Missing required source fields, type incompatibility between source and target, invalid mapping configuration, circular field references\n\n**Handling**: Create MappingFailure record with source field state, target schema requirements, and specific mapping rule that failed. Route to mapping error queue. If mapping failure rate exceeds `MAPPING_ERROR_THRESHOLD`, suspend processing and alert operators.\n\n**MappingFailure Structure**:\n```\nMappingFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  source_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  failed_mapping: string\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"MAP_001_MISSING_REQUIRED\"\n  error_message: string\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `beta_mapping_errors_total`, `beta_mapping_error_rate`, `beta_mapping_errors_by_schema`\n\n#### Transformation Errors\n\nOccur when field transformation operations produce invalid results or encounter unexpected input.\n\n**Common Causes**: Regex pattern failures, numeric overflow/underflow, date parsing failures, lookup table misses with FAIL policy, invalid encoding sequences\n\n**Handling**: Log transformation context including input value, rule configuration, and intermediate state. Apply configured fallback:\n- **FAIL**: Route entire record to error queue\n- **SKIP**: Leave field unchanged and continue\n- **DEFAULT**: Apply default value and continue\n- **NULL**: Set field to null and continue\n\n**TransformationError Structure**:\n```\nTransformationError:\n  record_id: string\n  rule_id: string\n  field_name: string\n  input_value: string\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"TRX_003_PATTERN_MISMATCH\"\n  error_message: string\n  intermediate_state: map<string, FieldValue>\n```\n\n**Configuration**: `TRANSFORM_ERROR_POLICY`, `TRANSFORM_MAX_RETRIES`, `TRANSFORM_TIMEOUT_MS`\n\n#### Enrichment Errors\n\nOccur when external data sources are unavailable or return unexpected results.\n\n**Common Causes**: Network connectivity issues, authentication failures, rate limiting, source timeout, malformed response data, lookup key not found\n\n**Transient Errors** (network, timeout): Retry with exponential backoff up to `ENRICHMENT_MAX_RETRIES`. If retries exhausted, apply configured fallback.\n\n**Permanent Errors** (not found, invalid key): Apply fallback immediately without retry.\n\n**Source Degradation**: Track error rates per enrichment source. When error rate exceeds `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD`, open circuit breaker for that source.\n\n**EnrichmentError Structure**:\n```\nEnrichmentError:\n  record_id: string\n  enrichment_source: string\n  lookup_key: string\n  error_category: enum          # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ENR_002_SOURCE_TIMEOUT\"\n  retry_count: integer\n  circuit_state: enum           # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Configuration**: `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD`, `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_TIMEOUT_MS`\n\n#### Quality Score Errors\n\nOccur when quality scoring cannot complete or produces invalid results.\n\n**Handling**: Quality scoring errors are generally non-fatal. Records receive a quality score of 0.0 with flags indicating scoring failure. Processing continues to Module Gamma.\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Errors\n\nOccur when system resources are depleted during transformation processing.\n\n**Common Causes**: Memory pressure from large records, thread pool saturation, connection pool depletion\n\n**Handling**: Resource exhaustion triggers graceful degradation:\n1. Pause acceptance of new batches from Module Alpha\n2. Complete in-flight transformations\n3. Clear transformation caches\n4. Signal unhealthy status\n5. Resume when resources recover\n\n### Error Queue Management\n\nFailed records route to categorized error queues:\n- `beta_mapping_errors`: Schema mapping failures\n- `beta_transform_errors`: Field transformation failures\n- `beta_enrichment_errors`: Enrichment operation failures\n- `beta_critical_errors`: Unrecoverable errors\n\n**Queue Operations**: Inspection (query failures), Correction (update and mark for reprocessing), Replay (reinject corrected records), Expiration (auto-purge after retention)\n\n**Configuration**: `ERROR_QUEUE_CAPACITY`, `ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS`\n\n### Error Logging\n\nAll errors generate structured log entries:\n\n```\nTransformationErrorLog:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  level: enum                   # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL\n  error_category: string\n  error_code: string\n  message: string\n  record_id: string\n  batch_id: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `beta_errors_total`, `beta_retries_total`, `beta_circuit_breaker_trips`\n\n**Gauges**: `beta_error_queue_size`, `beta_circuit_breaker_state`, `beta_degradation_mode`\n\n**Histograms**: `beta_error_recovery_duration`, `beta_retry_delay_seconds`\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n**Mapping Recovery**: Log failure → route to queue → increment counters → continue → alert if threshold exceeded\n\n**Transformation Recovery**: Capture state → apply fallback → log outcome → continue or route\n\n**Enrichment Recovery**: Detect type → retry if transient → apply fallback → update circuit → continue\n\n**Resource Recovery**: Detect pressure → pause intake → drain queues → clear caches → wait → resume\n\n### Error Escalation\n\nWhen error rates exceed configured thresholds, the system escalates through multiple levels:\n\n**Level 1 - Warning**: Log elevated error rates, emit alert metrics\n**Level 2 - Throttle**: Reduce intake rate from Module Alpha\n**Level 3 - Circuit Break**: Open circuit breakers for failing enrichment sources\n**Level 4 - Halt**: Suspend all processing pending operator intervention\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nModule Beta behavior is controlled through configuration parameters.\n\n### Pipeline Configuration\n\n#### TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 8 | **Range**: 1-64\n\nNumber of concurrent transformation threads.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_BATCH_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 500 | **Range**: 1-10000\n\nRecords processed per transformation batch.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 30000 | **Range**: 1000-300000\n\nMaximum time allowed for transforming a single record.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_QUEUE_CAPACITY\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5000 | **Range**: 100-100000\n\nMaximum records queued for transformation.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_PROFILE_DEFAULT\n\n**Type**: String | **Default**: \"standard\"\n\nNamed transformation profile applied when none specified.\n\n### Enrichment Configuration\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 3600 | **Range**: 60-86400\n\nTime-to-live in seconds for cached enrichment results.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_CACHE_MAX_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 100000 | **Range**: 1000-10000000\n\nMaximum entries in the enrichment cache.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5000 | **Range**: 100-60000\n\nTimeout for individual enrichment operations.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_MAX_RETRIES\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 3 | **Range**: 0-10\n\nMaximum retry attempts for transient enrichment failures.\n\n### Quality Configuration\n\n#### QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 0.7 | **Range**: 0.0-1.0\n\nQuality score below which a warning is logged.\n\n#### QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 0.3 | **Range**: 0.0-1.0\n\nQuality score below which the record is flagged as low quality.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Points\n\nModule Beta integrates with other Data Pipeline System components through well-defined interfaces.\n\n### Module Alpha Integration\n\nModule Beta receives validated records from Module Alpha through the standardized handoff protocol.\n\n**Handoff Reception**: Beta exposes an endpoint for receiving `TransformationRequest` batches. Upon receipt, Beta validates batch integrity, acknowledges receipt, and queues records for transformation.\n\n**Request Validation**: Verify batch checksum, confirm metadata, validate record count, check transformation profile exists.\n\n**Back-Pressure**: When queues approach capacity, Beta signals back-pressure through the integration layer, causing Alpha to pause delivery. See `integration-layer.md` for protocol details.\n\n### Module Gamma Integration\n\nModule Beta delivers transformed records to Module Gamma for output processing.\n\n**Handoff Payload**:\n```\nTransformationResponse:\n  batch_id: string\n  records: list<TransformedRecord>\n  transformation_summary: TransformationSummary\n  quality_summary: QualitySummary\n  checksum: string\n```\n\nFor complete handoff specifications, see `integration-layer.md`.\n\n### Enrichment Source Integration\n\nModule Beta connects to external enrichment sources:\n\n**Database Sources**: JDBC connections with pooling, health checking.\n\n**API Sources**: HTTP/HTTPS with authentication, rate limiting.\n\n**Cache Integration**: Distributed cache systems for enrichment caching.\n\n### Health Check Integration\n\nBeta exposes health status including component states, queue depths, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\n**Health Levels**: HEALTHY (normal), DEGRADED (reduced capacity), UNHEALTHY (processing halted)\n\n### Monitoring Integration\n\nBeta emits metrics for throughput, latency, quality, errors, and resources. Structured logs follow pipeline format.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\nModule Beta implements compliance controls for audit, regulatory, and security requirements.\n\n### Audit Logging\n\nAll transformation operations are logged:\n\n**Record-Level Audit**: Original state, all transformations with before/after values, quality scores, final state.\n\n**Rule-Level Audit**: Rule identifier, input/output values, execution timing.\n\nAudit requirements specified in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 3.\n\n### Data Lineage\n\nModule Beta maintains transformation lineage:\n\n**Lineage Capture**: Source record ID, transformation session, rule sequence, enrichment references, output record ID.\n\n**Lineage Query**: Forward tracing (input to outputs) and backward tracing (output to inputs).\n\nLineage requirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 4.\n\n### Data Protection\n\n**Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted during transformation.\n\n**Tokenization**: PII fields can be replaced with tokens.\n\n**Masking**: Fields can be partially masked for logging.\n\nRequirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 7.\n\n### Security Controls\n\n**Enrichment Source Authentication**: All external connections use appropriate authentication.\n\n**Transport Encryption**: Inter-module communication uses TLS.\n\n**Input Sanitization**: Transformation inputs are sanitized.\n\nRequirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 6.\n\n---\n\n*This document is the authoritative specification for Module Beta.

This specification establishes the authoritative contracts governing inter-module communication.\n\n### Purpose and Scope\n\nThe Integration Layer serves as the connective tissue binding Module Alpha (Data Ingestion), Module Beta (Data Transformation), and Module Gamma (Data Output) into a cohesive processing pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Protocol Definition**: Establishing the exact sequence of operations, message formats, and acknowledgment patterns for each inter-module handoff.\n\n**Flow Control**: Managing throughput variations between modules through back-pressure signaling, buffer management, and adaptive rate limiting.\n\n**Error Coordination**: Propagating error information across module boundaries in a structured format that preserves diagnostic context.\n\n**Health Coordination**: Aggregating health status from all modules to present a unified view of pipeline health.\n\n### Module Interaction Overview\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                   INTEGRATION LAYER OVERVIEW                     │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│    ┌──────────────────┐                                          │\n│    │   MODULE ALPHA   │  • Source Adapters  • Validation         │\n│    │  Data Ingestion  │  • Input Parsing    • Buffering          │\n│    └────────┬─────────┘                                          │\n│             │  ALPHA-BETA HANDOFF                                │\n│             │  ├─ Batch Transfer    ├─ Acknowledgment            │\n│             ▼  └─ Back-Pressure                                  │\n│    ┌──────────────────┐                                          │\n│    │   MODULE BETA    │  • Schema Mapping   • Enrichment         │\n│    │ Transformation   │  • Field Transform  • Quality Scoring    │\n│    └────────┬─────────┘                                          │\n│             │  BETA-GAMMA HANDOFF                                │\n│             │  ├─ Batch Transfer    ├─ Acknowledgment            │\n│             ▼  └─ Back-Pressure                                  │\n│    ┌──────────────────┐                                          │\n│    │   MODULE GAMMA   │  • Format Render    • Ack Handling       │\n│    │   Data Output    │  • Delivery Route   • Dead Letter Mgmt   │\n│    └──────────────────┘                                          │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n---\n\n## Message Formats\n\nThe Integration Layer defines standardized message formats for all inter-module communication.\n\n### Common Message Elements\n\n#### MessageHeader\n\n```\nMessageHeader:\n  message_id: string            # UUID v4 uniquely identifying this message\n  correlation_id: string        # Links related messages across the pipeline\n  source_module: enum           # ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA\n  target_module: enum           # ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA\n  message_type: enum            # BATCH_TRANSFER, ACKNOWLEDGMENT, BACKPRESSURE\n  timestamp: datetime           # ISO 8601 with microsecond precision, UTC\n  protocol_version: string      # Semantic version (e.g., \"1.0.0\")\n```\n\n#### BatchMetadata\n\n```\nBatchMetadata:\n  batch_id: string              # UUID v4 uniquely identifying this batch\n  sequence_number: integer      # Monotonically increasing per source module\n  record_count: integer         # Number of records in batch\n  checksum: string              # SHA-256 of batch contents\n  created_at: datetime          # When batch assembly completed\n```\n\n#### AcknowledgmentPayload\n\n```\nAcknowledgmentPayload:\n  batch_id: string              # Batch being acknowledged\n  status: enum                  # RECEIVED, PROCESSED, REJECTED\n  records_accepted: integer     # Successfully processed record count\n  records_rejected: integer     # Failed record count\n  processing_duration_ms: integer\n```\n\n### Alpha-Beta Message Formats\n\n```\nAlphaBetaBatchTransfer:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  metadata: BatchMetadata\n  records: list<ValidatedRecord>\n  validation_summary: ValidationSummary\n```\n\n```\nValidationSummary:\n  total_records_validated: integer\n  records_passed: integer\n  records_failed: integer\n  average_quality_score: float\n```\n\n### Beta-Gamma Message Formats\n\n```\nBetaGammaBatchTransfer:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  metadata: BatchMetadata\n  records: list<TransformedRecord>\n  transformation_summary: TransformationSummary\n  quality_summary: QualitySummary\n```\n\n```\nTransformationSummary:\n  total_records_transformed: integer\n  transformations_applied: integer\n  enrichment_cache_hit_rate: float\n```\n\n```\nQualitySummary:\n  average_quality_score: float\n  min_quality_score: float\n  max_quality_score: float\n  records_below_threshold: integer\n```\n\n---\n\n## Alpha-to-Beta Protocol\n\nThe Alpha-to-Beta protocol governs the transfer of validated records from the ingestion layer to the transformation layer.\n\n### Protocol Flow\n\n```\nMODULE ALPHA                                MODULE BETA\n────────────                                ───────────\n     │  1.

Examples: persistent connectivity loss, resource exhaustion, data corruption. Critical errors trigger alerts and may halt processing.\n\n**ERROR**: Failures preventing processing of specific records or batches without systemic failure. Examples: validation failures, transformation errors, delivery rejections.\n\n**WARNING**: Conditions that may indicate problems but do not prevent processing. Examples: elevated retry rates, degraded enrichment sources.\n\n#### Recoverability Classification\n\n**TRANSIENT**: May resolve through retry. Examples: network timeouts, temporary service unavailability, rate limiting. The Integration Layer applies retry logic with exponential backoff.\n\n**PERMANENT**: Will not resolve through retry. Examples: schema violations, invalid data formats, authorization failures. Bypass retry logic and proceed to error handling.\n\n#### Scope Classification\n\n**RECORD-LEVEL**: Affects individual records. Other records proceed normally.\n**BATCH-LEVEL**: Affects entire batches. All records in batch impacted.\n**MODULE-LEVEL**: Affects entire module operation.\n**PIPELINE-LEVEL**: Affects entire pipeline. All data flow halts.\n\n### Error Message Structure\n\n```\nIntegrationError:\n  error_id: string              # UUID v4 uniquely identifying this error\n  correlation_id: string        # Links to originating message/batch\n  timestamp: datetime           # When error was detected\n  source_module: enum           # ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA\n  severity: enum                # CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING\n  recoverability: enum          # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT, UNKNOWN\n  scope: enum                   # RECORD, BATCH, MODULE, PIPELINE\n  error_code: string            # Hierarchical code (e.g., \"INT_ALPHA_001\")\n  error_message: string         # Human-readable description\n  context: ErrorContext\n  retry_eligible: boolean\n```\n\n```\nErrorContext:\n  record_id: string             # Affected record (if record-level)\n  batch_id: string              # Affected batch (if batch-level)\n  field_name: string            # Affected field (if applicable)\n  expected_value: string\n  actual_value: string\n  upstream_errors: list<string> # Related upstream error IDs\n```\n\n### Module Alpha Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Alpha generates errors propagating through the Integration Layer. For complete specification, see `module-alpha.md` Section 5.\n\n**Connection Errors**: When source adapters cannot establish connectivity, Alpha generates MODULE-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer notifies downstream modules to expect reduced throughput.\n\n**Parse Errors**: When input parsing fails, Alpha generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. Failed records are excluded from batches with error details in batch metadata.\n\n**Validation Errors**: When records fail validation rules, Alpha generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer propagates summaries to Module Beta through `validation_summary`.\n\n**Buffer Overflow**: When Alpha's buffer reaches capacity without acknowledgment, Alpha generates MODULE-LEVEL errors triggering back-pressure protocols.\n\n### Module Beta Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Beta generates errors during transformation requiring Integration Layer coordination. For complete specification, see `module-beta.md` Section 5.\n\n**Mapping Errors**: When schema mapping fails, Beta generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer ensures failed records are excluded from downstream batches.\n\n**Transformation Errors**: When field transformations produce invalid results, Beta generates RECORD-LEVEL errors preserved in the transformation audit trail.\n\n**Enrichment Errors**: When external enrichment sources are unavailable, Beta generates errors with severity per configuration. The Integration Layer coordinates circuit breaker state.\n\n**Quality Score Failures**: When records fall below thresholds, Beta generates WARNING-level errors. The Integration Layer tracks quality degradation trends.\n\n### Module Gamma Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Gamma generates errors during output processing completing the error propagation chain. For complete specification, see `module-gamma.md` Section 6.\n\n**Rendering Errors**: When format rendering fails, Gamma generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer ensures failures are tracked against source records.\n\n**Routing Errors**: When no valid destination can be determined, Gamma generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer may trigger re-evaluation of upstream rules.\n\n**Delivery Errors**: When destination delivery fails, Gamma generates errors with severity based on retry status. The Integration Layer coordinates retry timing and circuit breaker state.\n\n**Acknowledgment Errors**: When acknowledgments timeout or fail, Gamma generates WARNING or ERROR level issues. The Integration Layer ensures ambiguous states are tracked for reconciliation.\n\n### Cross-Module Error Propagation\n\n#### Downstream Propagation\n\n```\nBatchErrorSummary:\n  upstream_errors: integer\n  error_breakdown: map<string, integer>\n  affected_record_ids: list<string>\n```\n\nDownstream modules use this to skip failed records and adjust expectations.\n\n#### Upstream Propagation\n\n```\nErrorNotification:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  errors: list<IntegrationError>\n  action_required: enum         # NONE, THROTTLE, HALT, INVESTIGATE\n```\n\nUpstream modules use this to adjust production rates and trigger alerts.\n\n### Circuit Breaker Coordination\n\n```\nCircuitBreakerState:\n  circuit_id: string\n  state: enum                   # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n  failure_count: integer\n  last_failure: datetime\n  next_attempt: datetime\n```\n\n**CLOSED**: Normal operation. Failures increment counter.\n**OPEN**: Requests immediately rejected. Timer until half-open.\n**HALF_OPEN**: Single test request allowed.\n\n```\nCircuitStateChange:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  circuit_id: string\n  previous_state: enum\n  new_state: enum\n  affected_modules: list<enum>\n```\n\n### Error Recovery Procedures\n\n**Transient Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff.

As the final stage in the pipeline, Module Gamma implements comprehensive format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management capabilities.\n    23→\n    24→### Core Responsibilities\n    25→\n    26→**Format Rendering**: Converting transformed records into output formats appropriate for each destination. The rendering engine supports JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom template-based formats. Rendering handles character encoding, field escaping, structural requirements, and format-specific validation.\n    27→\n    28→**Delivery Routing**: Directing records to appropriate destinations based on content attributes, quality scores, or explicit routing rules. The routing engine supports fan-out delivery where a single record is sent to multiple destinations, conditional routing based on record attributes, and priority-based queue management.\n    29→\n    30→**Acknowledgment Handling**: Tracking delivery status and processing confirmations from downstream consumers. The acknowledgment engine manages synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgment patterns, timeout detection, and delivery state persistence for recovery scenarios.\n    31→\n    32→**Dead Letter Queue Management**: Capturing records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts. The DLQ subsystem provides inspection, correction, replay, and expiration capabilities with comprehensive diagnostic information.\n    33→\n    34→### Processing Model\n    35→\n    36→Module Gamma processes records through a staged delivery pipeline:\n    37→\n    38→```\n    39→┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n    40→│                      MODULE GAMMA OUTPUT PIPELINE                            │\n    41→├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n    42→│  From Beta ──▶ ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n    43→│                │    Format    │    │   Delivery   │    │     Ack      │    │\n    44→│                │   Renderer   │───▶│    Router    │───▶│   Handler    │    │\n    45→│                └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    │\n    46→│                       │                   │                   │             │\n    47→│                       ▼                   ▼                   ▼             │\n    48→│                ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n    49→│                │   Render     │    │   Delivery   │    │     Ack      │    │\n    50→│                │   Errors     │    │   Failures   │    │   Timeouts   │    │\n    51→│                └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    │\n    52→│                                           │                                 │\n    53→│                                    ┌──────▼──────┐                         │\n    54→│                                    │  Dead Letter │                         │\n    55→│                                    │    Queue     │───▶ Inspection/Replay   │\n    56→│                                    └─────────────┘                         │\n    57→└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n    58→```\n    59→\n    60→### Design Principles\n    61→\n    62→**Reliable Delivery**: Every record is either successfully delivered with acknowledgment, or captured in the dead letter queue with diagnostic context.

Gamma sends record to destination, destination processes and responds in same connection, response indicates success or failure, Gamma updates delivery status immediately.\n   334→\n   335→**Applicable To**: Database writes with commit confirmation, synchronous HTTP APIs, file writes with fsync.\n   336→\n   337→#### Asynchronous Acknowledgment\n   338→\n   339→Confirmation arrives separately from delivery. Gamma sends record with correlation ID, destination returns immediate acceptance, destination processes record asynchronously, destination sends acknowledgment via callback or polling, Gamma matches acknowledgment to original delivery.\n   340→\n   341→**Applicable To**: Message queues with consumer acknowledgment, webhook-based integrations, batch processing systems.\n   342→\n   343→#### Batch Acknowledgment\n   344→\n   345→Multiple records acknowledged together. Gamma sends batch of records, destination processes entire batch, single acknowledgment covers all records in batch, Gamma updates status for all batch members.\n   346→\n   347→**Applicable To**: Bulk database inserts, batch file uploads, streaming platforms with batch commit.\n   348→\n   349→### Acknowledgment Timeout Handling\n   350→\n   351→When acknowledgments do not arrive within expected timeframes, Gamma maintains acknowledgment deadlines for all pending deliveries.

Stored state includes pending acknowledgment records, correlation mappings, timeout deadlines, and retry counts. On startup, Gamma loads pending acknowledgments and resumes timeout monitoring. Records with expired timeouts are processed according to `timeout_action`.\n   362→\n   363→---\n   364→\n   365→## Error Handling\n   366→\n   367→Module Gamma implements comprehensive error handling following the reliable delivery principle: every record is either confirmed delivered or captured with diagnostic context for recovery.\n   368→\n   369→### Error Categories\n   370→\n   371→#### Rendering Errors\n   372→\n   373→Occur when format rendering operations fail to produce valid output.\n   374→\n   375→**Common Causes**: Unsupported data types for target format, encoding incompatibilities, schema violations, template syntax errors, buffer overflow for oversized records.\n   376→\n   377→**Handling**: Create RenderingFailure record with input data, target format, and specific error.

As the final stage in the pipeline, Module Gamma implements comprehensive format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management capabilities.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Format Rendering**: Converting transformed records into output formats appropriate for each destination. The rendering engine supports JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom template-based formats. Rendering handles character encoding, field escaping, structural requirements, and format-specific validation.\n\n**Delivery Routing**: Directing records to appropriate destinations based on content attributes, quality scores, or explicit routing rules. The routing engine supports fan-out delivery where a single record is sent to multiple destinations, conditional routing based on record attributes, and priority-based queue management.\n\n**Acknowledgment Handling**: Tracking delivery status and processing confirmations from downstream consumers. The acknowledgment engine manages synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgment patterns, timeout detection, and delivery state persistence for recovery scenarios.\n\n**Dead Letter Queue Management**: Capturing records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts. The DLQ subsystem provides inspection, correction, replay, and expiration capabilities with comprehensive diagnostic information.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Gamma processes records through a staged delivery pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MODULE GAMMA OUTPUT PIPELINE                            │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  From Beta ──▶ ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n│                │    Format    │    │   Delivery   │    │     Ack      │    │\n│                │   Renderer   │───▶│    Router    │───▶│   Handler    │    │\n│                └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    │\n│                       │                   │                   │             │\n│                       ▼                   ▼                   ▼             │\n│                ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n│                │   Render     │    │   Delivery   │    │     Ack      │    │\n│                │   Errors     │    │   Failures   │    │   Timeouts   │    │\n│                └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    │\n│                                           │                                 │\n│                                    ┌──────▼──────┐                         │\n│                                    │  Dead Letter │                         │\n│                                    │    Queue     │───▶ Inspection/Replay   │\n│                                    └─────────────┘                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**Reliable Delivery**: Every record is either successfully delivered with acknowledgment, or captured in the dead letter queue with diagnostic context. No records are silently dropped.\n\n**Destination Agnosticism**: The core delivery logic remains independent of destination-specific protocols. Destination adapters encapsulate protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n\n**Ordered Delivery**: Within a single destination stream, records are delivered in the order received from Module Beta. Cross-destination ordering is not guaranteed.\n\n**Observable Operations**: All delivery stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis of delivery success rates and latencies.\n\n---\n\n## Output Destinations\n\nModule Gamma supports data delivery to multiple destination types through dedicated destination adapters.\n\n### Database Destinations\n\nDatabase destinations write records to relational and NoSQL databases:\n- **Relational Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server via JDBC with batch insert optimization and upsert support\n- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB with native driver integration and partition-aware routing\n- **Connection Management**: Pooling with health checking, automatic reconnection, and graceful degradation\n- **Write Modes**: Insert-only, upsert with configurable conflict resolution, append-only for time-series data\n\n### File System Destinations\n\nFile system destinations write records to local or networked file systems:\n- **Formats**: JSON (line-delimited or array), CSV, XML, Parquet with compression, Avro with schema evolution\n- **File Management**: Rotation by size, record count, or time interval with atomic staging and rename-on-complete\n- **Directory Structures**: Static paths, date-partitioned directories, content-based partitioning\n\n### API Destinations\n\nAPI destinations deliver records to external services via HTTP/HTTPS:\n- **Authentication**: API keys, OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh, HTTP Basic, mutual TLS\n- **Request Configuration**: Configurable HTTP methods, custom headers, request body templates\n- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling, exponential backoff, and circuit breaker patterns\n\n### Message Queue Destinations\n\nMessage queue destinations publish records to messaging systems:\n- **Platforms**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Azure Service Bus, Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n- **Delivery Semantics**: At-least-once with acknowledgment, exactly-once where supported\n- **Partitioning**: Key-based partition selection, round-robin distribution, custom strategies\n\n### Destination Adapter Interface\n\nAll destination adapters implement a common interface:\n\n```\nDestinationAdapter Interface:\n  - connect(): Establish connection to destination\n  - disconnect(): Release connection resources\n  - deliver(batch): Transmit batch of rendered records\n  - get_delivery_status(batch_id): Query delivery confirmation status\n  - get_metrics(): Return adapter-specific metrics\n  - health_check(): Verify destination availability\n```\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Gamma defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### DeliveryRequest\n\nRepresents a batch received from Module Beta for output processing:\n\n```\nDeliveryRequest:\n  request_id: string            # UUID v4 generated by Module Beta\n  batch_id: string              # Links to transformation batch\n  records: list<TransformedRecord>\n  priority: enum                # NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL\n  delivery_profile: string      #

Rule IDs evaluated\n  matched_rule: string          # Rule ID that matched\n  destinations: list<string>    # Selected destination IDs\n  routing_timestamp: datetime\n  routing_context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Formatting Rules\n\nModule Gamma implements a comprehensive formatting framework for output rendering.\n\n### Rule Categories\n\n- **Structural Rules**: Output structure and element ordering\n- **Encoding Rules**: Character encoding and escaping\n- **Type Rules**: Data type representation in output formats\n- **Null Rules**: Null and missing value handling\n- **Precision Rules**: Numeric precision and rounding\n\n### Standard Formatting Rules\n\n#### Rule 1: Field Inclusion Control\n\nDetermines which fields appear in rendered output.\n\n**Configuration**: `included_fields` (list), `excluded_fields` (list), `mode` (INCLUDE_ONLY, EXCLUDE_ONLY)\n\n**Behavior**: When `mode` is INCLUDE_ONLY, only fields in `included_fields` appear in output. When `mode` is EXCLUDE_ONLY, all fields except those in `excluded_fields` appear.\n\n#### Rule 2: Field Ordering\n\nControls the sequence of fields in rendered output.\n\n**Configuration**: `field_order` (list), `unspecified_position` (START, END, ALPHABETICAL)\n\n**Behavior**: Fields appear in the specified order. Fields not in the list are placed according to `unspecified_position`.\n\n#### Rule 3: Null Value Representation\n\nDefines how null values are rendered in output formats.\n\n**Configuration**: `null_representation` (map by format), `omit_null_fields` (boolean)\n\n**Behavior**: Null values are rendered according to format-specific rules. If `omit_null_fields` is true, fields with null values are excluded from output.\n\n#### Rule 4: Numeric Precision Control\n\nSpecifies decimal precision for numeric fields in output.\n\n**Configuration**: `precision_rules` (map), `default_precision` (integer), `rounding_mode`\n\n**Behavior**: Numeric fields are rounded to specified precision before rendering. Unspecified fields use `default_precision`.\n\n#### Rule 5: Date/Time Format Standardization\n\nControls datetime formatting in rendered output.\n\n**Configuration**: `datetime_format` (string), `timezone` (string), `include_timezone` (boolean)\n\n**Behavior**: All datetime fields are formatted according to the pattern and normalized to the specified timezone.\n\n#### Rule 6: String Escaping Policy\n\nDefines character escaping rules for string values.\n\n**Configuration**: `escape_rules` (map by format), `escape_unicode` (boolean)\n\n**Behavior**: Special characters are escaped according to format-specific rules. Unicode characters above U+007F are escaped if `escape_unicode` is enabled.\n\n#### Rule 7: Array Serialization Format\n\nControls how array fields are rendered.\n\n**Configuration**: `array_format` (NATIVE, DELIMITED, REPEATED), `delimiter` (string)\n\n**Behavior**: Arrays are serialized according to the specified format. NATIVE uses format-native arrays, DELIMITED joins elements with the delimiter, REPEATED creates multiple fields.\n\n### Rule Evaluation Order\n\n1. Field Inclusion Control (determine visible fields)\n2. Field Ordering (arrange field sequence)\n3. Null Value Representation (handle null values)\n4. Type-Specific Rules (numeric precision, datetime format)\n5. String Escaping (apply escaping rules)\n6. Array Serialization (format arrays)\n7. Final Validation (verify output conformance)\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgment Flow\n\nModule Gamma implements a comprehensive acknowledgment system to confirm successful delivery.\n\n### Acknowledgment Patterns\n\n#### Synchronous Acknowledgment\n\nThe delivery call returns confirmation before completing. Gamma sends record to destination, destination processes and responds in same connection, response indicates success or failure, Gamma updates delivery status immediately.\n\n**Applicable To**: Database writes with commit confirmation, synchronous HTTP APIs, file writes with fsync.\n\n#### Asynchronous Acknowledgment\n\nConfirmation arrives separately from delivery. Gamma sends record with correlation ID, destination returns immediate acceptance, destination processes record asynchronously, destination sends acknowledgment via callback or polling, Gamma matches acknowledgment to original delivery.\n\n**Applicable To**: Message queues with consumer acknowledgment, webhook-based integrations, batch processing systems.\n\n#### Batch Acknowledgment\n\nMultiple records acknowledged together. Gamma sends batch of records, destination processes entire batch, single acknowledgment covers all records in batch, Gamma updates status for all batch members.\n\n**Applicable To**: Bulk database inserts, batch file uploads, streaming platforms with batch commit.\n\n### Acknowledgment Timeout Handling\n\nWhen acknowledgments do not arrive within expected timeframes, Gamma maintains acknowledgment deadlines for all pending deliveries. A background process monitors for expired deadlines.\n\n**Response Options**:\n- **RETRY**: Redeliver and await new acknowledgment\n- **POLL**: Query destination for delivery status\n- **ESCALATE**: Route to error handling for manual review\n- **DLQ**: Move to dead letter queue\n\n### Acknowledgment Persistence\n\nAcknowledgment state is persisted to survive restarts. Stored state includes pending acknowledgment records, correlation mappings, timeout deadlines, and retry counts. On startup, Gamma loads pending acknowledgments and resumes timeout monitoring. Records with expired timeouts are processed according to `timeout_action`.\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nModule Gamma implements comprehensive error handling following the reliable delivery principle: every record is either confirmed delivered or captured with diagnostic context for recovery.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### Rendering Errors\n\nOccur when format rendering operations fail to produce valid output.\n\n**Common Causes**: Unsupported data types for target format, encoding incompatibilities, schema violations, template syntax errors, buffer overflow for oversized records.\n\n**Handling**: Create RenderingFailure record with input data, target format, and specific error. Route to rendering error queue. If rendering failure rate exceeds `RENDER_ERROR_THRESHOLD`, suspend processing and alert operators.\n\n**RenderingFailure Structure**:\n```\nRenderingFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  target_format: string\n  input_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"RENDER_001_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE\"\n  error_message: string\n  field_name: string            # Field that caused failure\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `gamma_render_errors_total`, `gamma_render_error_rate`, `gamma_render_errors_by_format`\n\n#### Routing Errors\n\nOccur when delivery routing cannot determine appropriate destinations.\n\n**Common Causes**: No matching routing rules, circular routing dependencies, disabled destinations, invalid destination configuration.\n\n**Handling**: Log routing context and route record to routing error queue. Records without valid destinations cannot proceed to delivery.\n\n**RoutingError Structure**:\n```\nRoutingError:\n  record_id: string\n  evaluated_rules: list<string>\n  routing_context: map<string, string>\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ROUTE_002_NO_MATCHING_RULE\"\n  error_message: string\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `gamma_routing_errors_total`, `gamma_routing_errors_by_rule`\n\n#### Connection Errors\n\nOccur when destination adapters cannot establish or maintain connectivity.\n\n**Common Causes**: Network unavailability, DNS resolution failure, TLS handshake errors, authentication failures, connection pool exhaustion, destination service outage.\n\n**Handling**: Retry with exponential backoff up to `MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES`. When retry limit exceeded, open circuit breaker for destination. Records targeting circuit-broken destinations enter a holding queue until circuit closes.\n\n**ConnectionError Structure**:\n```\nConnectionError:\n  destination_id: string\n  error_type: enum              # NETWORK, DNS, TLS, AUTH, POOL, SERVICE\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"CONN_003_TLS_HANDSHAKE\"\n  error_message: string\n  retry_count: integer\n  circuit_state: enum           # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Configuration**: `CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` (failures before opening), `CIRCUIT_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS` (time before half-open), `CIRCUIT_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` (successes to close).\n\n#### Delivery Errors\n\nOccur when transmission to destination fails despite successful connection.\n\n**Common Causes**: Destination rejection (validation failure, duplicate key), timeout during transmission, partial delivery failure, rate limiting, quota exhaustion.\n\n**Transient Errors** (timeout, rate limit): Retry with backoff. Track rate limit headers and respect retry-after directives.\n\n**Permanent Errors** (validation failure, duplicate): Route to DLQ without retry. Capture destination response for diagnosis.\n\n**DeliveryError Structure**:\n```\nDeliveryError:\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  attempt_number: integer\n  error_type: enum              # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"DELIV_004_RATE_LIMITED\"\n  destination_response: string\n  retry_eligible: boolean\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n#### Acknowledgment Errors\n\nOccur when delivery completes but acknowledgment processing fails.\n\n**Common Causes**: Acknowledgment timeout, malformed acknowledgment payload, correlation ID mismatch, acknowledgment callback failure.\n\n**Handling**: Acknowledgment errors are ambiguous—delivery may have succeeded. Apply `ACK_TIMEOUT_ACTION` configuration: RETRY_DELIVERY (risk: duplicates), ASSUME_SUCCESS (risk: lost records), QUERY_DESTINATION, or MANUAL_REVIEW.\n\n**AcknowledgmentError Structure**:\n```\nAcknowledgmentError:\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  ack_type: enum                # SYNC, ASYNC, BATCH\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ACK_002_TIMEOUT\"\n  error_message: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  expected_by: datetime\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Errors\n\nOccur when system resources are depleted during output processing.\n\n**Common Causes**: Memory pressure from large batches, thread pool saturation, file handle exhaustion, disk space depletion, network buffer overflow.\n\n**Handling**: Graceful degradation: signal back-pressure to Module Beta, complete in-flight deliveries, pause new batch acceptance, release non-essential resources, resume when resources recover.\n\n**Degradation Levels**: LEVEL_1 (reduce batch sizes), LEVEL_2 (pause low-priority destinations), LEVEL_3 (pause all batches, drain queues), LEVEL_4 (controlled shutdown with state persistence).\n\n### Error Queue Management\n\nFailed records route to categorized error queues: `gamma_render_errors`, `gamma_routing_errors`, `gamma_delivery_errors`, `gamma_ack_errors`, `gamma_dlq`.\n\n**Queue Operations**:\n- **Inspection**: Query failed records with filters by error type, destination, time range\n- **Correction**: Update record content or routing to resolve identified issues\n- **Replay**: Reinject records into delivery pipeline respecting current routing rules\n- **Expiration**: Records exceeding retention period are purged\n- **Bulk Operations**: Export, bulk replay with rate limiting, bulk expiration\n\n**Configuration**: `ERROR_QUEUE_CAPACITY`, `RENDER_ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `DELIVERY_ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS`\n\n### Error Logging\n\nAll errors generate structured log entries:\n\n```\nOutputErrorLog:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  level: enum                   # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL\n  error_category: string\n  error_code: string\n  message: string\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  batch_id: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  attempt_number: integer\n  context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n**Log Levels**: DEBUG (detailed diagnostics), INFO (normal events), WARN (recoverable issues), ERROR (failed operations), CRITICAL (system-level failures).\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `gamma_errors_total` (by category), `gamma_retries_total` (by destination), `gamma_dlq_entries_total`, `gamma_circuit_breaker_trips`\n\n**Gauges**: `gamma_error_queue_size`, `gamma_circuit_breaker_state`, `gamma_pending_acks`\n\n**Histograms**: `gamma_error_recovery_duration`, `gamma_retry_delay_seconds`, `gamma_dlq_age_seconds`\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n**Rendering Recovery**: Log failure → capture input state → route to queue → continue processing → alert if threshold exceeded.\n\n**Routing Recovery**: Log context → route to queue → apply default routing if configured → continue or hold.\n\n**Connection Recovery**: Detect failure → close resources → exponential backoff → reconnect → verify health → resume or escalate.\n\n**Delivery Recovery**: Capture response → classify error → retry if transient → DLQ if permanent → update metrics.\n\n**Acknowledgment Recovery**: Detect timeout → apply configured action → log ambiguity → update tracking.\n\n**Resource Recovery**: Detect pressure → signal back-pressure → drain queues → release resources → wait → resume gradually.\n\n### Error Escalation\n\nWhen error rates exceed configured thresholds, the system escalates:\n\n**Level 1 - Warning**: Elevated error rates logged, alert metrics emitted.\n\n**Level 2 - Throttle**: Reduce intake from Module Beta, prioritize critical deliveries.\n\n**Level 3 - Circuit Break**: Open circuit breakers for failing destinations.\n\n**Level 4 - Halt**: Suspend all processing pending operator intervention, persist state for recovery.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nModule Gamma behavior is controlled through configuration parameters.\n\n### Delivery Configuration\n\n#### OUTPUT_BATCH_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 500 | **Range**: 1-10000\n\nRecords processed per delivery batch.

This consolidation reduces integration complexity and provides a single point of data governance.\n    29→\n    30→**Data Quality Assurance**: Raw data from external sources frequently contains inconsistencies, missing values, and format variations. The pipeline applies comprehensive validation and transformation rules to ensure output data meets established quality standards before delivery to consumers.\n    31→\n    32→**Operational Efficiency**: By centralizing data processing logic in a purpose-built pipeline system, organizations avoid duplicating transformation code across multiple applications. Changes to data formats or business rules can be implemented once in the pipeline rather than propagated across numerous downstream systems.\n    33→\n    34→**Audit and Compliance**: Financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries require comprehensive audit trails for data movement and transformation. The Data Pipeline System provides built-in logging and traceability capabilities to support compliance requirements. For detailed compliance specifications, see `compliance-requirements.md`.\n    35→\n    36→### Technical Objectives\n    37→\n    38→The Data Pipeline System achieves its business objectives through the following technical capabilities:\n    39→\n    40→**High Throughput Processing**: The system is designed to process millions of records per hour through parallel processing and efficient memory utilization. Configurable batch sizes and worker pool settings allow operators to tune performance characteristics for specific deployment environments.\n    41→\n    42→**Fault Tolerance**: Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. The system isolates failures, routes problematic records to dead letter queues for later analysis, and continues processing valid data. Comprehensive error classification enables targeted remediation.\n    43→\n    44→**Extensibility**: New data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations can be added through well-defined interfaces without modifying core pipeline logic. The modular architecture supports incremental capability expansion.\n    45→\n    46→**Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and health check endpoints provide operators with real-time visibility into pipeline status, throughput, and error rates. Integration with standard monitoring platforms enables proactive alerting and capacity planning.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## Architecture Overview\n    51→\n    52→The Data Pipeline System follows a three-stage processing model where data flows sequentially through ingestion, transformation, and output modules. Each module is independently deployable and communicates with adjacent modules through well-defined message protocols.\n    53→\n    54→### System Architecture Diagram\n    55→\n    56→```\n

127→```\n   128→\n   129→### Module Boundaries\n   130→\n   131→Each module in the Data Pipeline System operates as a distinct processing unit with clearly defined responsibilities:\n   132→\n   133→**Module Alpha** handles all data ingestion concerns including source connectivity, input parsing, initial validation, and buffering. Alpha's primary responsibility is accepting raw data from external sources and converting it into the pipeline's internal record format. See `module-alpha.md` for the complete ingestion specification.\n   134→\n   135→**Module Beta** performs all data transformation operations including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment from reference sources, and quality scoring. Beta receives validated records from Alpha and produces enriched, normalized records ready for output. See `module-beta.md` for the complete transformation specification.\n   136→\n   137→**Module Gamma** manages all output concerns including format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management. Gamma receives transformed records from Beta and ensures reliable delivery to downstream consumers. See `module-gamma.md` for the complete output specification.\n   138→\n   139→### Inter-Module Communication\n   140→\n   141→Modules communicate through a standardized message protocol that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data integrity and traceability. The integration layer defines message formats, handoff procedures, and error propagation patterns. See `integration-layer.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n   142→\n   143→---\n   144→\n   145→## Module Summary\n   146→\n   147→This section provides a high-level overview of each module's responsibilities and key capabilities. For detailed specifications, consult the individual module documentation.\n   148→\n   149→### Module Alpha: Data Ingestion\n   150→\n   151→Module Alpha serves as the entry point for all data entering the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n   152→\n   153→**Source Connectivity**: Alpha supports multiple input source types including REST APIs, relational databases via JDBC, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file-based inputs (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet). Source adapters implement a common interface that abstracts connection management, authentication, and data retrieval.\n   154→\n   155→**Input Parsing**: Raw data from external sources is parsed into the pipeline's internal record format. The parsing engine handles various encodings, escape sequences, and format variations. Malformed inputs are captured with contextual error information for later analysis.\n   156→\n   157→**Validation Engine**: Alpha applies configurable validation rules to incoming records. Validations include type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity checks, and custom business rules. Records failing validation are routed to error handling with detailed failure descriptions.\n   158→\n   159→**Buffering and Flow Control**: To manage throughput variations between sources and downstream processing, Alpha maintains internal buffers with configurable size limits. Back-pressure mechanisms prevent memory exhaustion when downstream modules cannot keep pace with ingestion rates.\n   160→\n   161→Key configuration parameters include `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VALIDATION_STRICT_MODE`, and `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK`. See `module-alpha.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   162→\n   163→### Module Beta: Data Transformation\n   164→\n   165→Module Beta transforms ingested records into the format required by downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n   166→\n   167→**Schema Mapping**: Beta maps fields from the internal record format to target schemas. Mapping rules support field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic. Multiple output schemas can be active simultaneously.\n   168→\n   169→**Field Transformation**: Individual fields undergo transformation operations including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformation rules are evaluated in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent rules.\n   170→\n   171→**Data Enrichment**: Records can be enriched with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. Enrichment operations support caching to minimize repeated lookups for frequently referenced values.\n   172→\n   173→**Quality Scoring**: Each record receives a quality score based on completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns. Scores enable downstream consumers to make informed decisions about data reliability. Configurable thresholds trigger warnings or errors for low-quality records.\n   174→\n   175→Key configuration parameters include `TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM`, `ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR`, and `MAX_TRANSFORM_TIME_MS`. See `module-beta.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   176→\n   177→### Module Gamma: Data Output\n   178→\n   179→Module Gamma delivers transformed records to downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n   180→\n   181→**Format Rendering**: Records are rendered into output formats appropriate for each destination. Supported formats include JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom formats defined via templates. Rendering handles character encoding, escaping, and structural requirements.\n   182→\n   183→**Delivery Routing**: Records are routed to appropriate destinations based on content, quality scores, or configuration rules. Routing supports fan-out patterns where a single record is delivered to multiple destinations, as well as conditional routing based on record attributes.\n   184→\n   185→**Acknowledgment Handling**: Gamma tracks delivery status and processes acknowledgments from destinations. Successful deliveries update tracking records; failures trigger retry logic according to configured policies. Persistent failures route records to the dead letter queue.\n   186→\n   187→**Dead Letter Queue**: Records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts are written to a dead letter queue with comprehensive diagnostic information. Operators can inspect, correct, and replay failed records through administrative interfaces.\n   188→\n   189→Key configuration parameters include `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. See `module-gamma.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   190→\n   191→---\n   192→\n   193→## Data Flow\n   194→\n   195→Data moves through the pipeline in a sequential, stage-gated process. This section describes the end-to-end flow from source ingestion through final delivery.\n   196→\n   197→### Stage 1: Source Acquisition\n   198→\n   199→The pipeline execution begins when Module Alpha initiates data retrieval from configured sources. Source adapters establish connections, authenticate as necessary, and begin extracting data according to their specific protocols.\n   200→\n   201→For pull-based sources (databases, APIs), Alpha issues queries or requests according to configured schedules or triggers. For push-based sources (message queues, file drops), Alpha monitors inbound channels and processes data as it arrives.\n   202→\n   203→Raw data is captured in its native format and passed to the parsing engine. Source metadata including origin identifier, extraction timestamp, and batch sequence number is attached to each data unit.\n   204→\n   205→### Stage 2: Parsing and Initial Validation\n   206→\n   207→The parsing engine converts raw data into the pipeline's internal record format. Each source type has an associated parser that understands the source's data structure and extracts individual records.\n   208→\n   209→Parsing failures generate detailed error records capturing the malformed input, error location, and failure reason. Failed parses are logged and routed to error handling; they do not halt processing of valid records.\n   210→\n   211→Successfully parsed records undergo initial validation in Module Alpha. Validation rules check basic data integrity including required field presence, type conformance, and format validity. Records passing validation proceed to the buffering queue.\n   212→\n   213→### Stage 3: Module Handoff (Alpha to Beta)\n   214→\n   215→When the Alpha output buffer reaches the configured batch threshold or a flush timeout expires, accumulated records are packaged into a transfer batch. The batch includes metadata identifying the source batch, record count, and checksum.\n   216→\n   217→The integration layer mediates the handoff between Alpha and Beta. It validates batch integrity, manages flow control when Beta is processing slowly, and handles retry logic if the initial handoff fails. See `integration-layer.md` for handoff protocol details.\n   218→\n   219→Beta acknowledges batch receipt, at which point Alpha can release buffer space and proceed with additional ingestion. If acknowledgment is not received within the configured timeout, Alpha initiates retry procedures.\n   220→\n   221→### Stage 4: Transformation Processing\n   222→\n   223→Module Beta processes each record through its transformation pipeline. The transformation stages execute in sequence:\n   224→\n   225→**Schema Mapping** applies field mapping rules to convert records from the internal format to target schemas. Records may be mapped to multiple output schemas simultaneously.\n   226→\n   227→**Field Transformation** applies transformation rules to individual fields. Transformations execute in priority order, with each transformation potentially depending on results from earlier transformations.\n   228→\n   229→**Data Enrichment** augments records with data from external reference sources. The enrichment engine manages cache lookups, external service calls, and timeout handling.\n   230→\n   231→**Quality Scoring** evaluates each record against quality criteria and assigns a numeric score. Records below configured thresholds may be flagged, logged, or rejected depending on configuration.\n   232→\n   233→### Stage 5: Module Handoff (Beta to Gamma)\n   234→\n   235→Transformed records are batched for handoff to Module Gamma following the same batch protocol used between Alpha and Beta. The integration layer ensures reliable transfer with acknowledgment and retry support.\n   236→\n   237→Batch metadata is extended to include transformation summary statistics: record count, average quality score, error count, and enrichment hit rate. This metadata supports operational monitoring.\n   238→\n   239→### Stage 6: Output Rendering and Delivery\n   240→\n   241→Module Gamma receives transformed batches and routes individual records to their designated destinations. For each record:\n   242→\n   243→**Destination Determination** evaluates routing rules to identify target destinations. A record may have one or multiple destinations.\n   244→\n   245→**Format Rendering** converts the record to the format required by each destination. Rendering is performed independently for each destination, allowing different formats for the same record.\n   246→\n   247→**Delivery Execution** transmits the rendered record to the destination. The delivery engine manages connection pooling, authentication, and transmission protocols specific to each destination type.\n   248→\n   249→**Acknowledgment Processing** waits for confirmation of successful delivery. Confirmed records update completion tracking; failed records enter retry queues.\n   250→\n   251→### Stage 7: Completion and Reconciliation\n   252→\n   253→When all records in a batch have been delivered (or routed to dead letter queue after retry exhaustion), Gamma reports batch completion to upstream modules. Completion reports include delivery statistics: success count, retry count, DLQ count, and timing metrics.\n   254→\n   255→The pipeline maintains end-to-end tracking that enables reconciliation between ingested and delivered records. Discrepancies trigger alerts for operator investigation.\n   256→\n   257→---\n   258→\n   259→## Cross-Cutting Concerns\n   260→\n   261→Several concerns span multiple modules and require coordinated implementation. This section describes these cross-cutting aspects and references their detailed specifications.\n   262→\n   263→### Error Handling Philosophy\n   264→\n   265→The Data Pipeline System follows a \"fail forward\" error handling philosophy. Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. Instead, failed records are isolated, logged with diagnostic information, and routed to appropriate error handling channels while processing continues for valid records.\n   266→\n   267→Error handling operates at multiple levels:\n   268→\n   269→**Record-Level Errors** affect individual records and are handled within the module where they occur. The record is marked as failed, diagnostic information is captured, and the record is routed to the module's error queue.\n   270→\n   271→**Batch-Level Errors** affect entire batches (e.g., network failures during handoff) and are handled by the integration layer's retry mechanisms.\n   272→\n   273→**Module-Level Errors** affect module operation (e.g., resource exhaustion) and may require operator intervention.\n   274→\n   275→Each module documents its specific error handling behaviors. For cross-module error propagation patterns, see `integration-layer.md`.\n   276→\n   277→### Logging and Observability\n   278→\n   279→All modules emit structured log entries following a common format that enables log aggregation and analysis. Log entries include:\n   280→\n   281→- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n   282→- Module identifier\n   283→- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)\n   284→- Correlation ID linking related entries\n   285→- Structured payload with context-specific fields\n   286→\n   287→Metrics are emitted via a standard metrics interface supporting integration with Prometheus, StatsD, and similar platforms. Standard metrics include throughput rates, latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.\n   288→\n   289→Health check endpoints expose module status for load balancer and orchestration platform integration. See `integration-layer.md` for health check specifications.\n   290→\n   291→### Compliance and Audit Requirements\n   292→\n   293→The pipeline supports compliance requirements through comprehensive audit logging and data lineage tracking. Audit events capture:\n   294→\n   295→- Data origin and ingestion timestamp\n   296→- All transformation operations applied\n   297→- Delivery confirmation with destination and timestamp\n   298→- User or system actions affecting pipeline configuration\n   299→\n   300→Audit logs are retained according to configurable policies and can be exported to external audit systems. Compliance requirements are detailed in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n   301→\n   302→### Security Considerations\n   303→\n   304→Security is implemented through multiple mechanisms:\n   305→\n   306→**Transport Security**: All inter-module communication uses TLS encryption. External connections support TLS with certificate validation.\n   307→\n   308→**Authentication**: Source and destination connections use appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, certificates, database credentials).\n   309→\n   310→**Authorization**: Pipeline operations are governed by role-based access control. Configuration changes require elevated privileges.\n   311→\n   312→**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption supports scenarios where certain fields must remain protected through the pipeline.\n   313→\n   314→Detailed security requirements are specified in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n   315→\n   316→---\n   317→\n   318→## Configuration Management\n   319→\n   320→Pipeline configuration follows a hierarchical model where default values can be overridden at increasingly specific levels.\n   321→\n   322→### Configuration Hierarchy\n   323→\n   324→1. **System Defaults**: Built-in defaults for all configuration parameters\n   325→2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)\n   326→3. **Module Configuration**: Module-specific parameter overrides\n   327→4. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Settings for specific sources or destinations\n   328→\n   329→Lower levels in the hierarchy override higher levels, allowing targeted configuration while maintaining sensible defaults.\n   330→\n   331→### Configuration Parameters\n   332→\n   333→Each module defines its configuration parameters in its detailed specification. Cross-module parameters defined in this overview include:\n   334→\n   335→| Parameter | Default | Description |\n   336→|-----------|---------|-------------|\n   337→| `PIPELINE_NAME` | `default` | Identifier for this pipeline instance |\n   338→| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum log level to emit |\n   339→| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether to emit metrics |\n   340→| `METRICS_PREFIX` | `datapipeline` | Prefix for metric names |\n   341→| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` | `8080` | Port for health check endpoint |\n   342→\n   343→### Configuration Updates\n   344→\n   345→Configuration changes can be applied without pipeline restart through the configuration reload mechanism. Modules detect configuration changes and apply them at safe points in processing.\n   346→\n   347→Some parameters require restart due to their nature (e.g., network ports, resource pool sizes). These are documented in module specifications.\n   348→\n   349→---\n   350→\n   351→## Deployment Considerations\n   352→\n   353→The Data Pipeline System supports various deployment models from single-node development environments to distributed production clusters.\n   354→\n   355→### Deployment Modes\n   356→\n   357→**Standalone Mode**: All modules run within a single process, suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. Inter-module communication uses in-memory queues.\n   358→\n   359→**Distributed Mode**: Each module runs as an independent service, communicating via network protocols. This mode supports horizontal scaling and fault isolation.\n   360→\n   361→**Hybrid Mode**: Selected modules are co-located while others run independently, balancing deployment complexity against scaling requirements.\n   362→\n   363→### Scaling Considerations\n   364→\n   365→**Module Alpha** scales based on source volume and variety. Multiple Alpha instances can partition source responsibility, or a single instance can handle multiple sources with connection pooling.\n   366→\n   367→**Module Beta** scales based on transformation complexity. Transformation is inherently parallelizable; adding Beta instances provides near-linear throughput improvement.\n   368→\n   369→**Module Gamma** scales based on destination count and delivery latency. Destinations with high latency may require dedicated Gamma instances to prevent bottlenecks.\n   370→\n   371→### High Availability\n   372→\n   373→Production deployments should include:\n   374→\n   375→- Multiple instances of each module for failover\n   376→- Health monitoring with automatic instance replacement\n   377→- Persistent queues between modules to prevent data loss during failures\n   378→- Geographic distribution for disaster recovery scenarios\n   379→\n   380→---\n   381→\n   382→## Document References\n   383→\n   384→This overview document provides architectural context for the Data Pipeline System.

[Deployment Considerations](#deployment-considerations)\n\n---\n\n## System Purpose\n\nThe Data Pipeline System provides a robust, scalable platform for processing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data from multiple external sources through a series of transformation stages, ultimately delivering formatted output to various downstream consumers. The system is designed to handle batch and near-real-time processing workloads with configurable throughput characteristics.\n\n### Business Context\n\nModern enterprises generate and consume vast quantities of data from disparate sources including transactional databases, event streams, third-party APIs, and file-based exports. The Data Pipeline System addresses the fundamental challenge of consolidating, normalizing, and distributing this data in a consistent, reliable manner.\n\nThe system serves several critical business functions:\n\n**Data Consolidation**: Multiple upstream data sources are ingested through a unified interface, eliminating the need for point-to-point integrations between source systems and downstream consumers. This consolidation reduces integration complexity and provides a single point of data governance.\n\n**Data Quality Assurance**: Raw data from external sources frequently contains inconsistencies, missing values, and format variations. The pipeline applies comprehensive validation and transformation rules to ensure output data meets established quality standards before delivery to consumers.\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: By centralizing data processing logic in a purpose-built pipeline system, organizations avoid duplicating transformation code across multiple applications. Changes to data formats or business rules can be implemented once in the pipeline rather than propagated across numerous downstream systems.\n\n**Audit and Compliance**: Financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries require comprehensive audit trails for data movement and transformation. The Data Pipeline System provides built-in logging and traceability capabilities to support compliance requirements. For detailed compliance specifications, see `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n### Technical Objectives\n\nThe Data Pipeline System achieves its business objectives through the following technical capabilities:\n\n**High Throughput Processing**: The system is designed to process millions of records per hour through parallel processing and efficient memory utilization. Configurable batch sizes and worker pool settings allow operators to tune performance characteristics for specific deployment environments.\n\n**Fault Tolerance**: Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. The system isolates failures, routes problematic records to dead letter queues for later analysis, and continues processing valid data. Comprehensive error classification enables targeted remediation.\n\n**Extensibility**: New data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations can be added through well-defined interfaces without modifying core pipeline logic. The modular architecture supports incremental capability expansion.\n\n**Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and health check endpoints provide operators with real-time visibility into pipeline status, throughput, and error rates. Integration with standard monitoring platforms enables proactive alerting and capacity planning.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe Data Pipeline System follows a three-stage processing model where data flows sequentially through ingestion, transformation, and output modules. Each module is independently deployable and communicates with adjacent modules through well-defined message protocols.\n\n### System Architecture

clearly defined responsibilities:\n\n**Module Alpha** handles all data ingestion concerns including source connectivity, input parsing, initial validation, and buffering. Alpha's primary responsibility is accepting raw data from external sources and converting it into the pipeline's internal record format. See `module-alpha.md` for the complete ingestion specification.\n\n**Module Beta** performs all data transformation operations including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment from reference sources, and quality scoring. Beta receives validated records from Alpha and produces enriched, normalized records ready for output. See `module-beta.md` for the complete transformation specification.\n\n**Module Gamma** manages all output concerns including format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management. Gamma receives transformed records from Beta and ensures reliable delivery to downstream consumers. See `module-gamma.md` for the complete output specification.\n\n### Inter-Module Communication\n\nModules communicate through a standardized message protocol that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data integrity and traceability. The integration layer defines message formats, handoff procedures, and error propagation patterns. See `integration-layer.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n\n---\n\n## Module Summary\n\nThis section provides a high-level overview of each module's responsibilities and key capabilities. For detailed specifications, consult the individual module documentation.\n\n### Module Alpha: Data Ingestion\n\nModule Alpha serves as the entry point for all data entering the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Source Connectivity**: Alpha supports multiple input source types including REST APIs, relational databases via JDBC, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file-based inputs (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet). Source adapters implement a common interface that abstracts connection management, authentication, and data retrieval.\n\n**Input Parsing**: Raw data from external sources is parsed into the pipeline's internal record format. The parsing engine handles various encodings, escape sequences, and format variations. Malformed inputs are captured with contextual error information for later analysis.\n\n**Validation Engine**: Alpha applies configurable validation rules to incoming records. Validations include type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity checks, and custom business rules. Records failing validation are routed to error handling with detailed failure descriptions.\n\n**Buffering and Flow Control**: To manage throughput variations between sources and downstream processing, Alpha maintains internal buffers with configurable size limits. Back-pressure mechanisms prevent memory exhaustion when downstream modules cannot keep pace with ingestion rates.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VALIDATION_STRICT_MODE`, and `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK`. See `module-alpha.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n### Module Beta: Data Transformation\n\nModule Beta transforms ingested records into the format required by downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Schema Mapping**: Beta maps fields from the internal record format to target schemas. Mapping rules support field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic. Multiple output schemas can be active simultaneously.\n\n**Field Transformation**: Individual fields undergo transformation operations including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformation rules are evaluated in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent rules.\n\n**Data Enrichment**: Records can be enriched with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. Enrichment operations support caching to minimize repeated lookups for frequently referenced values.\n\n**Quality Scoring**: Each record receives a quality score based on completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns. Scores enable downstream consumers to make informed decisions about data reliability. Configurable thresholds trigger warnings or errors for low-quality records.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM`, `ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR`, and `MAX_TRANSFORM_TIME_MS`. See `module-beta.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n### Module Gamma: Data Output\n\nModule Gamma delivers transformed records to downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Format Rendering**: Records are rendered into output formats appropriate for each destination. Supported formats include JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom formats defined via templates. Rendering handles character encoding, escaping, and structural requirements.\n\n**Delivery Routing**: Records are routed to appropriate destinations based on content, quality scores, or configuration rules. Routing supports fan-out patterns where a single record is delivered to multiple destinations, as well as conditional routing based on record attributes.\n\n**Acknowledgment Handling**: Gamma tracks delivery status and processes acknowledgments from destinations. Successful deliveries update tracking records; failures trigger retry logic according to configured policies. Persistent failures route records to the dead letter queue.\n\n**Dead Letter Queue**: Records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts are written to a dead letter queue with comprehensive diagnostic information. Operators can inspect, correct, and replay failed records through administrative interfaces.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. See `module-gamma.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Data Flow\n\nData moves through the pipeline in a sequential, stage-gated process. This section describes the end-to-end flow from source ingestion through final delivery.\n\n### Stage 1: Source Acquisition\n\nThe pipeline execution begins when Module Alpha initiates data retrieval from configured sources. Source adapters establish connections, authenticate as necessary, and begin extracting data according to their specific protocols.\n\nFor pull-based sources (databases, APIs), Alpha issues queries or requests according to configured schedules or triggers. For push-based sources (message queues, file drops), Alpha monitors inbound channels and processes data as it arrives.\n\nRaw data is captured in its native format and passed to the parsing engine. Source metadata including origin identifier, extraction timestamp, and batch sequence number is attached to each data unit.\n\n### Stage 2: Parsing and Initial Validation\n\nThe parsing engine converts raw data into the pipeline's internal record format. Each source type has an associated parser that understands the source's data structure and extracts individual records.\n\nParsing failures generate detailed error records capturing the malformed input, error location, and failure reason. Failed parses are logged and routed to error handling; they do not halt processing of valid records.\n\nSuccessfully parsed records undergo initial validation in Module Alpha. Validation rules check basic data integrity including required field presence, type conformance, and format validity. Records passing validation proceed to the buffering queue.\n\n### Stage 3: Module Handoff (Alpha to Beta)\n\nWhen the Alpha output buffer reaches the configured batch threshold or a flush timeout expires, accumulated records are packaged into a transfer batch. The batch includes metadata identifying the source batch, record count, and checksum.\n\nThe integration layer mediates the handoff between Alpha and Beta. It validates batch integrity, manages flow control when Beta is processing slowly, and handles retry logic if the initial handoff fails. See `integration-layer.md` for handoff protocol details.\n\nBeta acknowledges batch receipt, at which point Alpha can release buffer space and proceed with additional ingestion. If acknowledgment is not received within the configured timeout, Alpha initiates retry procedures.\n\n### Stage 4: Transformation Processing\n\nModule Beta processes each record through its transformation pipeline. The transformation stages execute in sequence:\n\n**Schema Mapping** applies field mapping rules to convert records from the internal format to target schemas. Records may be mapped to multiple output schemas simultaneously.\n\n**Field Transformation** applies transformation rules to individual fields. Transformations execute in priority order, with each transformation potentially depending on results from earlier transformations.\n\n**Data Enrichment** augments records with data from external reference sources. The enrichment engine manages cache lookups, external service calls, and timeout handling.\n\n**Quality Scoring** evaluates each record against quality criteria and assigns a numeric score. Records below configured thresholds may be flagged, logged, or rejected depending on configuration.\n\n### Stage 5: Module Handoff (Beta to Gamma)\n\nTransformed records are batched for handoff to Module Gamma following the same batch protocol used between Alpha and Beta. The integration layer ensures reliable transfer with acknowledgment and retry support.\n\nBatch metadata is extended to include transformation summary statistics: record count, average quality score, error count, and enrichment hit rate. This metadata supports operational monitoring.\n\n### Stage 6: Output Rendering and Delivery\n\nModule Gamma receives transformed batches and routes individual records to their designated destinations. For each record:\n\n**Destination Determination** evaluates routing rules to identify target destinations. A record may have one or multiple destinations.\n\n**Format Rendering** converts the record to the format required by each destination. Rendering is performed independently for each destination, allowing different formats for the same record.\n\n**Delivery Execution** transmits the rendered record to the destination. The delivery engine manages connection pooling, authentication, and transmission protocols specific to each destination type.\n\n**Acknowledgment Processing** waits for confirmation of successful delivery. Confirmed records update completion tracking; failed records enter retry queues.\n\n### Stage 7: Completion and Reconciliation\n\nWhen all records in a batch have been delivered (or routed to dead letter queue after retry exhaustion), Gamma reports batch completion to upstream modules. Completion reports include delivery statistics: success count, retry count, DLQ count, and timing metrics.\n\nThe pipeline maintains end-to-end tracking that enables reconciliation between ingested and delivered records. Discrepancies trigger alerts for operator investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\nSeveral concerns span multiple modules and require coordinated implementation. This section describes these cross-cutting aspects and references their detailed specifications.\n\n### Error Handling Philosophy\n\nThe Data Pipeline System follows a \"fail forward\" error handling philosophy. Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. Instead, failed records are isolated, logged with diagnostic information, and routed to appropriate error handling channels while processing continues for valid records.\n\nError handling operates at multiple levels:\n\n**Record-Level Errors** affect individual records and are handled within the module where they occur. The record is marked as failed, diagnostic information is captured, and the record is routed to the module's error queue.\n\n**Batch-Level Errors** affect entire batches (e.g., network failures during handoff) and are handled by the integration layer's retry mechanisms.\n\n**Module-Level Errors** affect module operation (e.g., resource exhaustion) and may require operator intervention.\n\nEach module documents its specific error handling behaviors. For cross-module error propagation patterns, see `integration-layer.md`.\n\n### Logging and Observability\n\nAll modules emit structured log entries following a common format that enables log aggregation and analysis. Log entries include:\n\n- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n- Module identifier\n- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)\n- Correlation ID linking related entries\n- Structured payload with context-specific fields\n\nMetrics are emitted via a standard metrics interface supporting integration with Prometheus, StatsD, and similar platforms. Standard metrics include throughput rates, latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\nHealth check endpoints expose module status for load balancer and orchestration platform integration. See `integration-layer.md` for health check specifications.\n\n### Compliance and Audit Requirements\n\nThe pipeline supports compliance requirements through comprehensive audit logging and data lineage tracking. Audit events capture:\n\n- Data origin and ingestion timestamp\n- All transformation operations applied\n- Delivery confirmation with destination and timestamp\n- User or system actions affecting pipeline configuration\n\nAudit logs are retained according to configurable policies and can be exported to external audit systems. Compliance requirements are detailed in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSecurity is implemented through multiple mechanisms:\n\n**Transport Security**: All inter-module communication uses TLS encryption. External connections support TLS with certificate validation.\n\n**Authentication**: Source and destination connections use appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, certificates, database credentials).\n\n**Authorization**: Pipeline operations are governed by role-based access control. Configuration changes require elevated privileges.\n\n**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption supports scenarios where certain fields must remain protected through the pipeline.\n\nDetailed security requirements are specified in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Management\n\nPipeline configuration follows a hierarchical model where default values can be overridden at increasingly specific levels.\n\n### Configuration Hierarchy\n\n1. **System Defaults**: Built-in defaults for all configuration parameters\n2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)\n3. **Module Configuration**: Module-specific parameter overrides\n4. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Settings for specific sources or destinations\n\nLower levels in the hierarchy override higher levels, allowing targeted configuration while maintaining sensible defaults.\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\nEach module defines its configuration parameters in its detailed specification. Cross-module parameters defined in this overview include:\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `PIPELINE_NAME` | `default` | Identifier for this pipeline instance |\n| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum log level to emit |\n| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether to emit metrics |\n| `METRICS_PREFIX` | `datapipeline` | Prefix for metric names |\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` | `8080` | Port for health check endpoint |\n\n### Configuration Updates\n\nConfiguration changes can be applied without pipeline restart through the configuration reload mechanism. Modules detect configuration changes and apply them at safe points in processing.\n\nSome parameters require restart due to their nature (e.g., network ports, resource pool sizes). These are documented in module specifications.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Considerations\n\nThe Data Pipeline System supports various deployment models from single-node development environments to distributed production clusters.\n\n### Deployment Modes\n\n**Standalone Mode**: All modules run within a single process, suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. Inter-module communication uses in-memory queues.\n\n**Distributed Mode**: Each module runs as an independent service, communicating via network protocols. This mode supports horizontal scaling and fault isolation.\n\n**Hybrid Mode**: Selected modules are co-located while others run independently, balancing deployment complexity against scaling requirements.\n\n### Scaling Considerations\n\n**Module Alpha** scales based on source volume and variety. Multiple Alpha instances can partition source responsibility, or a single instance can handle multiple sources with connection pooling.\n\n**Module Beta** scales based on transformation complexity. Transformation is inherently parallelizable; adding Beta instances provides near-linear throughput improvement.\n\n**Module Gamma** scales based on destination count and delivery latency. Destinations with high latency may require dedicated Gamma instances to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### High Availability\n\nProduction deployments should include:\n\n- Multiple instances of each module for failover\n- Health monitoring with automatic instance replacement\n- Persistent queues between modules to prevent data loss during failures\n- Geographic distribution for disaster recovery scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Document References\n\nThis overview document provides architectural context for the Data Pipeline System.

Here are my findings:\n\n### Critical Finding: Context Mismatch\n\n**Finding 0: This WPD is a test artifact, not a real implementation plan**\n\nThe `docs/wpds/refactor-hard.md` document references a \"Data Pipeline System\" with modules Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. However:\n\n- This repository is the **Phantom Reads Investigation** project (per PRD.md)\n- There is **no Data Pipeline implementation code** in this repository\n- The `docs/specs/` directory contains synthetic specification documents designed to trigger multi-file read operations for phantom read testing\n- The WPD appears to be a contrived exercise document\n\n**Question for User**: Is this WPD intended as:\n1. A **test artifact** for phantom read investigation (no implementation expected)?\n2. A **hypothetical exercise** to practice `/refine-plan` review?\n3. An **actual implementation plan** that should be refined for future work?\n\n---\n\n### Assuming Hypothetical Review (for practice/completeness):\n\nIf we treat this as a real implementation plan, here are issues I identified:\n\n### Finding 1: Missing Error Code Schema Definition\n\nThe WPD proposes error code namespaces (`ALPHA_xxx`, `BETA_xxx`, `GAMMA_xxx`, `INT_xxx`) in Task 1.3, but the specifications already define error codes with different patterns:\n- Module Alpha uses: `VAL_001_TYPE_MISMATCH`, `PARSE_001_INVALID_JSON`\n- Module Beta uses: `MAP_001_MISSING_REQUIRED`, `TRX_003_PATTERN_MISMATCH`, `ENR_002_SOURCE_TIMEOUT`\n- Module Gamma uses: `RENDER_001_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE`, `ROUTE_002_NO_MATCHING_RULE`, `CONN_003_TLS_HANDSHAKE`\n- Integration Layer uses: `INT_ALPHA_001` hierarchical pattern\n\n**Issue**: The WPD's proposed naming conflicts with existing spec-defined codes. Task 1.3 needs to address migration/reconciliation of existing codes.\n\n### Finding 2: Compliance Requirements Not Referenced\n\nThe WPD references `compliance-requirements.md` but doesn't incorporate its error logging requirements:\n- Requirement 3.1: All audit log entries must include specific fields\n- Requirement 3.5: Audit log integrity via cryptographic checksums\n\n**Issue**: Phase 3 (Observability) tasks don't reference compliance requirements for audit logging format. Task 3.3 should explicitly ensure compliance with Section 3.\n\n### Finding 3: Integration Layer Already Defines Error Propagation\n\nThe Integration Layer spec (`integration-layer.md`) already defines:\n- `IntegrationError` structure with severity, recoverability, scope\n- Cross-module error propagation via `BatchErrorSummary` and `ErrorNotification`\n- Circuit breaker coordination\n\n**Issue**: Task 1.5 (\"Design the error propagation protocol\") duplicates existing spec. The WPD should specify whether this is a redesign or enhancement.\n\n### Finding 4: Missing Test Strategy\n\nThe WPD has no testing phase. Given this is a cross-cutting refactor affecting all modules, there should be:\n- Unit tests for ErrorRegistry core functionality\n- Integration tests for cross-module error propagation\n- Regression tests ensuring existing error handling behavior is preserved\n\n### Finding 5: Severity Levels Alignment\n\nTask 1.4 proposes: `CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO`\n\nExisting specs use:\n- Log levels: `DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL` (5 levels)\n- Error severity: `CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING` (3 levels in IntegrationError)\n\n**Issue**: The proposed 4-level scheme (`INFO` as severity?) conflicts with existing patterns. Clarification needed.\n\n### Finding 6: No Rollback/Fallback Strategy\n\nA cross-cutting refactor affecting all three modules simultaneously is high-risk. The WPD should include:\n- Feature flag for gradual rollout\n- Fallback to legacy error handling if issues detected\n- Phased module-by-module migration approach\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The WPD requires clarification on its purpose (test artifact vs. real plan). If intended as a real implementation plan, it needs refinement to address existing error code patterns, compliance requirements, existing integration layer protocols, testing strategy, and rollback approach.\n\nWhat would you like to do next?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":575,"cache_read_input_tokens":124708,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":575,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1089,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXMnxiBhWi6L4EzpNZNAS","type":"assistant","uuid":"d3a8a289-049c-4804-8ec9-6fb053737659","timestamp":"2026-01-22T04:34:46.678Z"}

I ran `/wsd:boot` which triggered reads of multiple system files - the skill result showed the content was returned inline in the system reminders\n\n3. I read the target WPD `docs/wpds/refactor-hard.md` - I received the full content inline (46 lines)\n\n4. I then read 6 specification files in parallel:\n   - `docs/specs/data-pipeline-overview.md` - received inline (426 lines)\n   - `docs/specs/module-alpha.md` - received inline (743 lines)\n   - `docs/specs/module-beta.md` - received inline (742 lines)\n   - `docs/specs/module-gamma.md` - received inline (772 lines)\n   - `docs/specs/integration-layer.md` - received inline (530 lines)\n   - `docs/specs/compliance-requirements.md` - received inline (393 lines)\n\nLooking at my function results, I can see that all of these returned the actual file content - I can see line numbers and actual content in each response. None of them returned `<persisted-output>` markers.\n\nI should report honestly about my experience. I did NOT experience phantom reads in this session - I received all file contents inline and was able to read them fully.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":108926,"cache_read_input_tokens":20104,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":108926,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXMo5PYUYjX7fW7xDHcvc","type":"assistant","uuid":"47f129a6-d244-401e-9ac6-78d5f02f9ca1","timestamp":"2026-01-22T04:36:01.506Z"}
