    12→During `/wsd:boot`, I read and understood the following core system documents:
    13→
    14→1. `docs/read-only/Agent-System.md` - Elite team model, User Agent/Special Agent roles, workflow phases
    15→2. `docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` - Strict rules governing agent behavior (Rules 1.x-6.x)
    16→3. `docs/core/Design-Decisions.md` - Project-specific design philosophies (Decisions 1-12)
    17→4. `docs/read-only/Documentation-System.md` - Documentation organization and lifecycle
    18→5. `docs/read-only/Checkboxlist-System.md` - Five checkbox states, Phase 0 blocking, parent-child relationships
    19→6. `docs/read-only/Workscope-System.md` - Workscope file format, DFS selection algorithm, immutability

    25→### Files Read Per Project-Bootstrapper Instructions
    26→
    27→The following files were read in their entirety as commanded by the Project-Bootstrapper agent:
    28→
    29→1. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`
    30→2. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`
    31→3. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`
    32→4. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`
    33→5. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`
    34→6. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Testing-Configuration-Variables-Standards.md`
    35→7. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Process-Integrity-Standards.md`
    36→8. `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`

    38→### Understanding of Critical Rules
    39→
    40→**Rule 5.1 - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY:** This app has not shipped yet. No migration scripts, no migration notes, no "legacy support" code. Refactors should make the codebase appear as if it was always designed the new way.
    41→
    42→**Rule 3.4 - NO META-COMMENTARY IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS:** Do not include phase numbers, task references, or planning artifacts in source code, tests, scripts, or configuration files. These belong only in process documents (Feature Overviews, tickets, Action Plans).
    43→
    44→**Rule 3.11 - READ-ONLY DIRECTORY WORKAROUND:** If I need to edit a file in `docs/read-only/` or `.claude/` and get a write access error, I should copy that file to `docs/workbench/` keeping the exact same filename, then make edits to the workbench copy.
    45→
    46→**Rule 4.4 - cat >> file << EOF IS FORBIDDEN:** Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`, etc.) to write to files. Use standard tools (Edit, Write, etc.) to interact with files.
    47→
    48→**Rule 3.12 - Proof of Work Verification:** Do NOT accept Special Agent reports without proper evidence (test summary lines, health check tables, file paths).
    49→
    50→### Understanding of WSD Runtime vs Development Distinction
    51→
    52→**WSD Runtime (the shipping product):**
    53→- Lives in `source/` directory
    54→- ALL code changes must target `source/`
    55→- `source/wsd.py` and `source/scripts/` are the product
    56→
    57→**WSD Development (dogfood and infrastructure):**
    58→- Root-level `wsd.py` and `scripts/` are DOGFOOD copies - DO NOT EDIT
    59→- `tests/` contains the test suite (editable, tests the Runtime)
    60→- `dev/scripts/` contains WSD Development-only scripts (editable)
    61→
    62→**Rule 6.1.5 - The Path Resolution Trap:** Scripts in `source/scripts/` use paths like `project_root = script_dir.parent`. This is CORRECT for deployment. Do NOT "fix" this to `script_dir.parent.parent` just because the file currently lives at `source/scripts/foo.py` during development.
    63→
    64→### Key Standards Understood
    65→
    66→**Coding Standards:**
    67→- Be aggressive about failures at point of failure
    68→- Handle external uncertainties gracefully but be strict about internal logic
    69→- Simplify and favor Sources of Truth
    70→- Use comment blocks at file start and for all classes/functions
    71→- Check comment blocks after edits
    72→- 4 spaces for indentation
    73→
    74→**Python Standards:**
    75→- Use `uv` for dependency management
    76→- Use `ruff` for linting/formatting, `mypy` for type checking, `pytest` for testing
    77→- ALL functions must have explicit return type annotations
    78→- Type parameters must be lowercase (`list[int]` not `List[int]`)
    79→- Document all public functions with Google-style docstrings
    80→- Test methods must document ALL parameters including pytest fixtures
    81→
    82→**Test Environment Isolation:**
    83→- Every test must explicitly control environment variables with `@patch.dict(os.environ, {...}, clear=True)`
    84→- Tests must never read from or write to actual user directories (use `tmp_path`)
    85→- Unit tests must mock all network calls
    86→- Module-level derived constants must ALL be patched (not just base constants)
    87→
    88→**Configuration Testing:**
    89→- Two types required: Mechanism tests AND Integration tests
    90→- Integration tests must use real config files, not mocked ConfigManager
    91→- Test precedence: CLI > Env > Config > Default
    92→
    93→**Process Integrity:**
    94→- Automation must produce functionally equivalent results to direct tool execution
    95→- No silent suppression of errors or warnings
    96→- All exceptions require explicit User approval
    97→
    98→**Specification Maintenance:**
    99→- When code changes, specifications must change
   100→- Configuration options, environment variables, and CLI changes all require spec updates
   101→- Workscopes with code changes are incomplete until specifications are updated
   102→
   103→### Prepared for Custom Workscope
   104→
   105→I am now fully onboarded and prepared to receive a custom workscope from the User. I understand:
   106→- The rules and standards that govern my work
   107→- The project structure and what directories to edit vs. not edit
   108→- The testing standards required for any code changes
   109→- The need to update specifications alongside code changes
   110→- The proof of work requirements for Special Agent approvals
   111→

   114→## Awaiting Custom Workscope

   116→Status: Halted pending User-provided custom workscope assignment.
