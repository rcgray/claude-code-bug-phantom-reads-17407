Most common usage is simply `/wsd:init` with no arguments.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n/wsd:init\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init Do all of Phase 5, but not Phase 6\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init --custom\n```\n\n---\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV wsd-init-project-introduction>\nWe are building an AI orchestration system for projects that tightly integrate AI-assisted development with Claude Code (and other platforms with similar feature support). The name of this project is Workscope-Dev (https://workscope.dev), often abbreviated \"WSD\". It is a collection of templates, agent definitions, rule systems, and developer scripts that make working with AI Assistants more efficient.\n\nOur goal is different than typical Python projects that aim to build a package. Instead, we are building an orchestration system, and our deliverable is a set of files that exist in the `source/` directory of this repository. We refer to the deliverable directory internally as the \"WSD Runtime\" and it is what will eventually ship to end-users. This repository around the WSD Runtime is referred to (internally) as the WSD Development project, and end-users will not have access to it. To further complicate things, the WSD Development project _uses_ WSD in its endeavors to create the WSD Runtime, so there are places where you will see duplicate files (e.g., `wsd.py` and `source/wsd.py`). Files inside the `source/` directory are the product we ship; files outside the `source/` directory are where we are using the product we ship (a WSD installation) to further develop the product (files in the `source/` directory).\n\nYou should read the following key project files before you begin work:\n- `docs/core/PRD.md` ( @docs/core/PRD.md )\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\nFirst Directive: Print a message acknowledging that you read the content in the `wsd-init-project-introduction` section immediately above and followed all directions therein.\n\n## Workscope System\n\nRun the `/wsd:boot` command to read the necessary files for understanding the Workscope-Dev Platform. When it is complete, return here and finish the remaining instructions.\n\n## Workscope ID Generation\n\nGenerate a unique Workscope ID for this session based on the current timestamp:\n\n1. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp\n2. Report your Workscope ID, which is derived from this timestamp according to the pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n\n**Remember this Workscope ID** as you will use it throughout your session for:\n- Work Journal naming\n- Workscope file naming (if fetching from Task-Master)\n- All agent communications\n\n## Work Journal\n\nYour next preparation task is to start a new \"Work Journal\" for YOUR fresh session with the Workscope ID:\n\n**CRITICAL - Work Journal in Archive Location:**\n\nRun the Work Journal initialization script, substituting your Workscope ID in the command below. Note that `[Workscope ID]` is strictly the `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` identifier, with no added prefix or suffix:\n\n(bash):\n   bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh \"[Workscope ID]\"\n\nThis script will create a new Work Journal directly in the archive location at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`. Verify that this file exists and was properly formed (with the correct filename).\n\nThis file is now YOUR \"Work Journal,\" and you will be continually adding to it over the course of YOUR session as you proceed through your workscope. Be sure to update your Work Journal after each step so this real time monitoring can take place.\n\n**CRITICAL**: `cat >> file << EOF` IS FORBIDDEN. It is an anti-pattern that will likely result in full rejection of your contributions. Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`) to write to files. Use your standard tools (e.g., Read, Edit, etc.) to interact with files throughout your session. You will be reminded of this as **Rule 4.4** in the Agent Rules.\n\n## Task-Master Assignment (Conditional)\n\n**IF `$1` is `--custom`:**\n- Run the `/wsd:onboard` command and return to this command\n- Skip the rest of this section and continue to \"## Completion Behavior\"\n- You will receive your workscope directly from the User after this command completes\n\n**OTHERWISE (including if `$1` is empty):**\n- Consult @agent-task-master to fetch your workscope assignment\n- Provide the Task-Master with your Workscope ID that you generated earlier\n- Workscope directive (forward to Task-Master if provided): $1\n\nThe Task-Master has complete instructions in its definition and will:\n  - Create a workscope file at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`\n  - Mark the selected tasks with `[*]` in the relevant checkboxlists\n  - Return the workscope file path to you\n\nRead the workscope file. **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Your workscope will assign SPECIFIC TASK NUMBERS (e.g., \"3.5, 3.6, 3.7\") for execution. While you should understand the entire phase as context for how your tasks fit into the larger picture, you are responsible for EXECUTING only your assigned task numbers.\n\nMANDATORY: After reading your workscope file, literally copy the ENTIRE, VERBATIM content of the workscope document into the Work Journal. Do this before moving on to the next step. The User will read your Work Journal, and if the User does not see the exact, verbatim text of your workscope file present in the Work Journal after it was assigned to you by the Task-Master agent, your entire session will be immediately terminated.\n\n### Phase Inventory Validation\n\nBefore accepting, check the Phase Inventory for this error: \"CLEAR (all [%])\" or any \"CLEAR\" with a qualifier. Phases with `[%]` items are NOT CLEAR.\n\nIf you detect this error: Reject the workscope. Tell Task-Master to delete the invalid workscope file and redo the assignment correctly. This is the one exception to workscope immutability—an invalid workscope must be replaced.\n\n## Completion Behavior\n\nUpon completing the initialization steps above, return to the User with a clear message at the END of your reply.\n\nMANDATORY: Put the following text at the END of your reply, verbatim:\n**\"WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: propose changes, describe the workscope, or `/wsd:prepare`. To abandon completely, `/wsd:abort`.\"**\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe command should handle these error conditions:\n\n1. **Agent communication failures**: Retry agent communications if they fail\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --custom"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"31bf5dd6-d976-4599-b074-800c74ed94e3","timestamp":"2026-01-20T17:51:41.678Z"}

If 100% exists and matches spec exactly, confirm it (rare)\n\n**Common Failure Mode:** Agent sees existing code, assumes it's done, skips verification, misses critical gaps, work gets rejected.\n\n### FILE PROTECTION SYSTEM\n\nThe pre-tool-use hook enforces restrictions:\n\n**READ-BLOCKED (you cannot even view these):**\n- `dev/archive/**`\n- `dev/diagrams/**`\n- `dev/experiments/**`\n- `dev/misc/**`\n- `dev/prompts/**`\n- `dev/workbench/**`\n- `.env`\n\n**EDIT-BLOCKED (read-only):**\n- `docs/read-only/**` (all standards and system docs)\n- `docs/references/**` (templates and archives)\n- `dev/template/**`\n- Root-level dogfood files (wsd.py, scripts/)\n\n**If you need to write to a blocked directory:** See Rule 3.11 in Agent-Rules.md (which you've already read).\n\n### PHASE 0 PRIORITY\n\nIf your workscope contains ANY Phase 0 items, those are BLOCKING. Complete them before touching anything else. Phase 0 is for urgent issues discovered during execution, not foundational work.\n\n### QUALITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS\n\nBefore considering your work complete:\n\n1. **Run health checks:**\n   ```bash\n   /Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/wsd.py health:clean\n   ```\n   The `:clean` flag clears caches for deterministic validation.\n\n2. **For Python changes:**\n   - Tests must pass: `uv run pytest`\n   - Must import from `source/` not root `scripts/`\n   - Must use fixtures from `tests/conftest.py` for isolation\n\n3. **For TypeScript/JavaScript changes:**\n   - Tests must pass: `npm test`\n   - Must follow ES2022 standards (this is a JavaScript project, not TypeScript)\n\n4. **All changes:**\n   - Must target `source/` directory (the product)\n   - Must update tests if behavior changes\n   - Must not include meta-commentary\n   - Must not provide backward compatibility\n\n## YOUR NEXT STEPS\n\n1. **WAIT for your custom workscope from the User**\n2. **Once you receive it, STOP and identify which standards apply**\n3. **READ every applicable standard file from the list above IN ITS ENTIRETY**\n4. **DO NOT skip files thinking you \"already know\" the content**\n5. **CONFIRM with me that you've read the applicable standards**\n6. **HALT and check in with the User before beginning execution**\n\n## FINAL WARNINGS\n\n- Your work will be reviewed by Documentation-Steward and Rule-Enforcer who have VETO POWER\n- A single violation of Agent-Rules.md results in complete rejection\n- Test-Guardian will reject work that reduces coverage or introduces regressions\n- The Health-Inspector will verify all quality checks pass with `:clean` flag\n- Breaking the WSD Runtime vs Dogfood separation is an automatic rejection\n\n**You are fully prepared for onboarding, but you MUST read the task-specific standards once you receive your workscope assignment.**\n\nOnce the User provides your custom workscope, tell me what type of work it involves, and I will confirm which standards files you must read before proceeding.\n\n**Remember: After receiving your workscope and reading applicable standards, you MUST halt and check in with the User before beginning execution.**"}],"totalDurationMs":53529,"totalTokens":13179,"totalToolUseCount":1,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":799,"cache_read_input_tokens":10552,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":799,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1822,"service_tier":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"d23c2fab-ea54-41c5-9a8e-e6045d03dd59"}

After the Pre-Staging-Script feature populates `source/wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, all subsequent pipeline stages read their file lists from the manifest instead of re-scanning the filesystem using `collect_wsd_files()`.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the manifest-based file list retrieval pattern, the pipeline stages that must adopt it, the distinction between installable and stageable file lists, and the migration path from empirical scanning to manifest-driven operations.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context on the WSD distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Manifest-Driven Pipeline serves four critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes `file_hashes.keys()` from `wsd.json` as the authoritative list of WSD Runtime files, eliminating redundant scanning logic across pipeline stages\n    20→\n    21→2. **Consistency Guarantee**: Ensures all pipeline stages operate on the same file list, preventing subtle bugs from differing exclusion rule implementations or race conditions between stages\n    22→\n    23→3. **Simplification**: Removes duplicated `collect_wsd_files()` calls from multiple scripts, reducing code complexity and maintenance burden\n    24→\n    25→4. **Pipeline Integrity**: Ensures that files validated and hashed by `pre_staging.py` are exactly the files processed by subsequent stages, creating an unbroken chain of custody\n    26→\n    27→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories (installable vs stageable), and which pipeline components must be modified to use manifest-based retrieval.\n    28→\n    29→## Prerequisite Dependency\n    30→\n    31→**STATUS**: The Pre-Staging-Script feature is **COMPLETE**. This feature builds upon that foundation.\n    32→\n    33→The Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n    34→\n    35→- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n    36→- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n    37→- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n    38→\n    39→With `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n    40→\n    41→**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n    42→\n    43→## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n    44→\n    45→### Core Principle\n    46→\n    47→After `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n    48→\n    49→**Derivation Formula**:\n    50→- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n    51→- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n    52→\n    53→**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n    54→\n    55→### Why Two Categories\n    56→\n    57→**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n    58→\n    59→**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n    60→\n    61→**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n    62→\n    63→### File List Retrieval Pattern\n    64→\n    65→Each component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n    66→\n    67→**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n    68→```python\n    69→metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\n    70→files = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n    71→```\n    72→\n    73→**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n    74→```python\n    75→metadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    76→file_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\n    77→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n    78→```\n    79→\n    80→### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n    81→\n    82→Per project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n    83→\n    84→Local helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n    85→\n    86→### Manifest Trust Model\n    87→\n    88→**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n    89→\n    90→**Rationale**:\n    91→- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n    92→- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n    93→- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n    94→- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n    95→\n    96→## Pipeline Stages Affected\n    97→\n    98→### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n    99→\n   100→`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n   101→\n   102→### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   103→\n   104→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n   105→\n   106→**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n   107→\n   108→**Files Affected**:\n   109→- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   110→\n   111→### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   112→\n   113→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n   114→\n   115→**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json`.\n   116→\n   117→**Files Affected**:\n   118→- `dev/scripts/build_package.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   119→\n   120→### Stage 4: wsd.py Install/Update (Manifest Consumer)\n   121→\n   122→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` in multiple locations:\n   123→- `detect_collisions()`: Scans source directory for collision detection during install\n   124→- `install_files()`: Scans source directory for file installation\n   125→- `calculate_required_disk_space()`: Scans source directory for disk space calculation\n   126→- `categorize_update_files()`: Scans source directory for update file categorization\n   127→\n   128→**Required Change**: Use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` instead of scanning with `collect_wsd_files()` in all four functions.\n   129→\n   130→**Files Affected**:\n   131→- `source/wsd.py`: Update `detect_collisions()`, `install_files()`, `calculate_required_disk_space()`, `categorize_update_files()`\n   132→\n   133→### Out of Scope: diff_installation.py\n   134→\n   135→`diff_installation.py` is a development utility script for comparing WSD installations. While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration. This script is not part of the core distribution pipeline and does not affect end-user installations.\n   136→\n   137→## Error Handling\n   138→\n   139→### Error Categories\n   140→\n   141→#### 1.

Missing or Empty file_hashes Field\n   155→\n   156→**Error**: `wsd.json` exists but `file_hashes` field is missing or empty\n   157→\n   158→**Example Messages**:\n   159→```\n   160→Error: wsd.json does not contain file_hashes field\n   161→The manifest appears to be from an older version or was not properly generated.\n   162→Run pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n   163→```\n   164→\n   165→```\n   166→Error: wsd.json contains empty file_hashes\n   167→The WSD Runtime must contain at least one file.\n   168→Run pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n   169→```\n   170→\n   171→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to populate `file_hashes`.\n   172→\n   173→**Validation Requirement**: All pipeline stages that read the manifest MUST validate that `file_hashes` is both present AND non-empty. An empty `file_hashes` indicates a manifest that was not properly generated or a corrupt state—there is no valid \"empty WSD Runtime\" scenario.\n   174→\n   175→#### 3. Missing File During Copy\n   176→\n   177→**Error**: A file listed in `file_hashes` does not exist on disk\n   178→\n   179→**Example Message**:\n   180→```\n   181→Error: Cannot copy file: /path/to/source/.claude/agents/task-master.md\n   182→File is listed in wsd.json but does not exist.\n   183→This may indicate the manifest is out of sync with the filesystem.\n   184→Run pre_staging.py to resynchronize.\n   185→```\n   186→\n   187→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to rescan and update the manifest.\n   188→\n   189→#### 4. Missing Hash Entry During Update\n   190→\n   191→**Error**: During install or update, a file path has no corresponding entry in `file_hashes`\n   192→\n   193→**Example Message**:\n   194→```\n   195→Error: Missing hash for 'scripts/health_check.py' in wsd.json manifest.\n   196→The manifest may be out of sync with source files.\n   197→Regenerate wsd.json with pre_staging.py.\n   198→```\n   199→\n   200→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to regenerate the manifest with current file hashes.\n   201→\n   202→### Error Recovery Principles\n   203→\n   204→**Guarantee**: If the manifest is missing or malformed, operations fail fast with clear instructions to run `pre_staging.py`.\n   205→\n   206→**Contract**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT attempt to regenerate the manifest themselves. The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n   207→\n   208→## Design Decisions\n   209→\n   210→### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n   211→\n   212→**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n   213→\n   214→1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n   215→2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n   216→3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n   217→4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n   218→\n   219→**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list.

However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n   239→\n   240→**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n   241→```python\n   242→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n   243→```\n   244→\n   245→This is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n   246→\n   247→## Testing Scenarios\n   248→\n   249→**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories.

After the Pre-Staging-Script feature populates `source/wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, all subsequent pipeline stages read their file lists from the manifest instead of re-scanning the filesystem using `collect_wsd_files()`.\n\nThis specification defines the manifest-based file list retrieval pattern, the pipeline stages that must adopt it, the distinction between installable and stageable file lists, and the migration path from empirical scanning to manifest-driven operations.\n\nFor broader architectural context on the WSD distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Manifest-Driven Pipeline serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes `file_hashes.keys()` from `wsd.json` as the authoritative list of WSD Runtime files, eliminating redundant scanning logic across pipeline stages\n\n2. **Consistency Guarantee**: Ensures all pipeline stages operate on the same file list, preventing subtle bugs from differing exclusion rule implementations or race conditions between stages\n\n3. **Simplification**: Removes duplicated `collect_wsd_files()` calls from multiple scripts, reducing code complexity and maintenance burden\n\n4. **Pipeline Integrity**: Ensures that files validated and hashed by `pre_staging.py` are exactly the files processed by subsequent stages, creating an unbroken chain of custody\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories (installable vs stageable), and which pipeline components must be modified to use manifest-based retrieval.\n\n## Prerequisite Dependency\n\n**STATUS**: The Pre-Staging-Script feature is **COMPLETE**. This feature builds upon that foundation.\n\nThe Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n\n- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n\nWith `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n\n**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n\n## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n\n### Core Principle\n\nAfter `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n\n**Derivation Formula**:\n- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n\n**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n\n### Why Two Categories\n\n**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n\n**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n\n**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n\n### File List Retrieval Pattern\n\nEach component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n\n**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n```python\nmetadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\nfiles = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n```\n\n**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n```python\nmetadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\nfile_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\nfiles = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n```\n\n### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n\nPer project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n\nLocal helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n\n### Manifest Trust Model\n\n**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n\n## Pipeline Stages Affected\n\n### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n\n`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n\n### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n\n**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n\n### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n\n**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json`.\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `dev/scripts/build_package.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n\n### Stage 4: wsd.py Install/Update (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` in multiple locations:\n- `detect_collisions()`: Scans source directory for collision detection during install\n- `install_files()`: Scans source directory for file installation\n- `calculate_required_disk_space()`: Scans source directory for disk space calculation\n- `categorize_update_files()`: Scans source directory for update file categorization\n\n**Required Change**: Use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` instead of scanning with `collect_wsd_files()` in all four functions.\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `source/wsd.py`: Update `detect_collisions()`, `install_files()`, `calculate_required_disk_space()`, `categorize_update_files()`\n\n### Out of Scope: diff_installation.py\n\n`diff_installation.py` is a development utility script for comparing WSD installations. While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration. This script is not part of the core distribution pipeline and does not affect end-user installations.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Missing Manifest Errors\n\n**Error**: `wsd.json` does not exist or cannot be read\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Cannot read wsd.json at /path/to/source/wsd.json\nThis file must exist and contain file_hashes.\nRun pre_staging.py first to generate the manifest.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to generate `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`.\n\n#### 2. Missing or Empty file_hashes Field\n\n**Error**: `wsd.json` exists but `file_hashes` field is missing or empty\n\n**Example Messages**:\n```\nError: wsd.json does not contain file_hashes field\nThe manifest appears to be from an older version or was not properly generated.\nRun pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n```\n\n```\nError: wsd.json contains empty file_hashes\nThe WSD Runtime must contain at least one file.\nRun pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to populate `file_hashes`.\n\n**Validation Requirement**: All pipeline stages that read the manifest MUST validate that `file_hashes` is both present AND non-empty. An empty `file_hashes` indicates a manifest that was not properly generated or a corrupt state—there is no valid \"empty WSD Runtime\" scenario.\n\n#### 3. Missing File During Copy\n\n**Error**: A file listed in `file_hashes` does not exist on disk\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Cannot copy file: /path/to/source/.claude/agents/task-master.md\nFile is listed in wsd.json but does not exist.\nThis may indicate the manifest is out of sync with the filesystem.\nRun pre_staging.py to resynchronize.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to rescan and update the manifest.\n\n#### 4. Missing Hash Entry During Update\n\n**Error**: During install or update, a file path has no corresponding entry in `file_hashes`\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Missing hash for 'scripts/health_check.py' in wsd.json manifest.\nThe manifest may be out of sync with source files.\nRegenerate wsd.json with pre_staging.py.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to regenerate the manifest with current file hashes.\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: If the manifest is missing or malformed, operations fail fast with clear instructions to run `pre_staging.py`.\n\n**Contract**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT attempt to regenerate the manifest themselves. The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n\n**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n\n1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n\n**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n\n1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n\n### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n\nPer Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n- No complex logic to encapsulate\n- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n\n### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n\n`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n\n**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n```python\nfiles = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n```\n\nThis is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories. Example:\n```python\n# CORRECT:\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"source\" / \"scripts\"))\n\n# INCORRECT:\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"scripts\"))\n```\n\n### Basic Manifest Reading Tests\n\n1. **Valid Manifest Reading**: Read file list from valid `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, verify list matches manifest keys\n\n2. **Stageable File List**: Get stageable files, verify `wsd.json` is included alongside `file_hashes.keys()`\n\n3. **Installable File List**: Get installable files, verify `wsd.json` is NOT included\n\n### Error Handling Tests\n\n1. **Missing wsd.json**: Attempt to read manifest from directory without `wsd.json`, verify clear error and instructions\n\n2. **Missing file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` without `file_hashes` field, verify error points to `pre_staging.py`\n\n3. **Empty file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` with empty `file_hashes`, verify error is raised (empty file_hashes is never valid)\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Pipeline Flow**: Run `pre_staging.py`, then `stage_release.py`, then `build_package.py`, verify all stages use manifest file list\n\n2. **Staged File Verification**: After staging, verify staged files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`\n\n3. **Install File Verification**: After install, verify installed files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` (without `wsd.json`)\n\n4. **Update File Verification**: Run update operation, verify file categorization uses manifest-based file list\n\n### Regression Tests\n\n1. **No collect_wsd_files Calls**: After implementation, grep codebase to verify `collect_wsd_files()` only called in `pre_staging.py`\n\n2. **Exclusion Consistency**: Verify files excluded by `pre_staging.py` (via `.wsdignore`, suspicious patterns) are consistently absent from all pipeline stages\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Pipeline Script Maintainers\n\n1. **Never Add New Scanning**: If you need a file list, read it from the manifest. Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n\n2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n\n3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n\n### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n\n1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n\n2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n\n3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling. All implementations must conform to these specifications.*\n\n\n## In-Flight Failures (IFF)\n\n\n## Feature Implementation Plan (FIP)\n\n### Phase 1: Stage Release Script Updates\n\n- [ ] **1.1** - Remove `collect_wsd_files()` usage from `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`\n  - [ ] **1.1.1** - Add function to read file list from manifest (`file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`)\n  - [ ] **1.1.2** - Update `stage_files()` to use manifest-derived file list\n  - [ ] **1.1.3** - Remove or simplify verification logic that depended on scanning\n  - [ ] **1.1.4** - Add error handling for missing/malformed/empty manifest\n  - [ ] **1.1.5** - Remove unused `collect_wsd_files` import from script\n- [ ] **1.2** - Update `tests/test_stage_release.py`\n  - [ ] **1.2.1** - Add tests for manifest-based file list retrieval\n  - [ ] **1.2.2** - Add tests for error handling (missing manifest, missing file_hashes, empty file_hashes)\n  - [ ] **1.2.3** - Update existing tests to work with manifest-based approach\n\n### Phase 2: Build Package Script Updates\n\n- [ ] **2.1** - Remove `collect_wsd_files()` usage from `dev/scripts/build_package.py`\n  - [ ] **2.1.1** - Add function to read file list from staging manifest\n  - [ ] **2.1.2** - Update `copy_staged_files()` to use manifest-derived file list\n  - [ ] **2.1.3** - Add error handling for missing/malformed/empty manifest\n  - [ ] **2.1.4** - Remove unused `collect_wsd_files` import from script\n- [ ] **2.2** - Update build package tests\n  - [ ] **2.2.1** - Update `tests/test_build_package.py` for manifest-based file list\n  - [ ] **2.2.2** - Update `tests/test_build_package_integration.py` for manifest approach\n\n### Phase 3: WSD Install/Update Operations\n\n- [ ] **3.1** - Update `source/wsd.py` install operations to use manifest-based file lists\n  - [ ] **3.1.1** - Update `detect_collisions()` to use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` for file list\n  - [ ] **3.1.2** - Update `install_files()` to use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` for file list\n  - [ ] **3.1.3** - Update `calculate_required_disk_space()` to use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` for file list\n  - [ ] **3.1.4** - Add validation in `read_wsd_metadata()` that `file_hashes` is non-empty (empty manifest indicates `pre_staging.py` was not run or source has no files)\n- [ ] **3.2** - Update `source/wsd.py` update operations to use manifest-based file lists\n  - [ ] **3.2.1** - Update `categorize_update_files()` to use `update_metadata.file_hashes.keys()` for file list\n- [ ] **3.3** - Remove unused `collect_wsd_files` import from `source/wsd.py`\n- [ ] **3.4** - Update install/update tests in `tests/test_wsd_cli.py`\n  - [ ] **3.4.1** - Update install tests for manifest-based file list\n  - [ ] **3.4.2** - Update update tests for manifest-based file list\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation Updates\n\n- [%] **4.1** - Update `docs/features/stage-release-script/Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md`\n  - [%] **4.1.1** - Document manifest-based file list retrieval\n  - [%] **4.1.2** - Remove or update references to `collect_wsd_files()` scanning\n- [ ] **4.2** - Update `docs/features/install-and-update/Installation-System.md`\n  - [ ] **4.2.1** - Document manifest-based installation file list\n- [ ] **4.3** - Update `docs/features/install-and-update/Update-System.md`\n  - [ ] **4.3.1** - Document manifest-based update file categorization\n- [ ] **4.4** - Update `docs/core/WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md`\n  - [ ] **4.4.1** - Document that `file_hashes.keys()` serves as canonical installable file list\n  - [ ] **4.4.2** - Document the two file list categories (installable vs stageable)\n  - [ ] **4.4.3** - Fix incorrect statement that `stage_release.py` generates hashes (should reference `pre_staging.py`)\n\n### Phase 5: Verification and Cleanup\n\n- [ ] **5.1** - Verify no remaining `collect_wsd_files()` calls outside `pre_staging.py`\n  - [ ] **5.1.1** - Grep codebase for `collect_wsd_files` usage\n  - [ ] **5.1.2** - Confirm only `pre_staging.py` calls this function\n- [ ] **5.2** - Run full test suite to verify no regressions\n  - [ ] **5.2.1** - Run `./wsd.py test` and verify all tests pass\n  - [ ] **5.2.2** - Run `./wsd.py health` and verify all checks pass\n- [ ] **5.3** - Integration verification (MUST use isolated temporary directories, NOT live staging/dist)\n  - [ ] **5.3.1** - Run full pipeline in temp dirs: `pre_staging.py` -> `stage_release.py` -> `build_package.py`\n  - [ ] **5.3.2** - Verify staged and packaged files match manifest\n","numLines":390,"startLine":1,"totalLines":390}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"b961b702-0df9-441d-aea8-a1d10576137a"}

The Stage Release Script is a prerequisite to the Build-System feature, which handles subsequent PyPI packaging from the staged files.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context and how the Stage Release Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Stage Release Script serves four critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a sanitized copy of WSD Runtime by filtering out development artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `.envrc`) that should not be distributed to end users\n    20→\n    21→2. **Git Separation**: Enables the GitHub publishing workflow by staging files to a separate repository (`../workscope-dev/`) with its own git history, preserving the `.git/` directory during staging operations\n    22→\n    23→3. **Source Purity Enforcement**: Validates that `source/` remains clean by halting on unexpected files (suspicious files, symlinks, empty directories), enforcing Design Decision 9 (Keep WSD Runtime Directory Pure and Ship-Ready)\n    24→\n    25→4. **Release Automation**: Provides a repeatable, idempotent process for preparing releases, eliminating manual file copying and the risk of accidentally shipping development artifacts\n    26→\n    27→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and the `.wsdignore` file format.\n    28→\n    29→## Script Architecture\n    30→\n    31→### Script Location\n    32→\n    33→The script lives at `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n    34→\n    35→- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n    36→- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools\n    37→- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n    38→\n    39→**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates on `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n    40→\n    41→### Command Interface\n    42→\n    43→```bash\n    44→# Stage to default sibling directory (../workscope-dev/)\n    45→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n    46→\n    47→# Preview what would be staged (no actual changes)\n    48→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n    49→\n    50→# Stage to specific directory (for testing)\n    51→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --target /path/to/target\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→### Behavioral Guarantees\n    55→\n    56→| Aspect            | Behavior                                |\n    57→| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n    58→| Target default    | `../workscope-dev/` (sibling directory) |\n    59→| Target override   | `--target /path/to/dir` flag            |\n    60→| Verbosity         | Always verbose (lists all files)        |\n    61→| Clean before copy | Always cleans target (except `.git/`)   |\n    62→| Verification      | Always verifies after staging           |\n    63→| Sync mode         | Full sync only (no incremental mode)    |\n    64→| Git operations    | None (user handles git manually)        |\n    65→| Target creation   | Never creates target (must exist)       |\n    66→\n    67→**Guarantee**: The script is idempotent.

If not, the script MUST exit with a clear error message. The script MUST NOT create the target directory.\n   145→\n   146→2. **Git directory validation**: If the target contains `.git/`, it MUST be a real directory, not a symlink. If `.git/` is a symlink, the script MUST halt with an error.\n   147→\n   148→3. **Git warning**: If the target directory does not contain a `.git/` subdirectory, the script SHOULD warn the user (this may indicate incorrect target selection).\n   149→\n   150→#### Phase 2: Load Patterns\n   151→\n   152→Two distinct pattern sets are loaded with different behaviors:\n   153→\n   154→1. **`.wsdignore` entries**: Files listed in `source/.wsdignore` that exist for WSD Development but should not ship. These are **skipped quietly** during staging.\n   155→\n   156→2. **Suspicious file patterns**: Built-in patterns identifying development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. These **cause an error** if detected.\n   157→\n   158→See **Exclusion Pattern System** section for complete pattern list.\n   159→\n   160→#### Phase 3: Pre-scan Source for Errors\n   161→\n   162→Before modifying the target directory, the script MUST validate all source files. This ensures that if any error is detected, the target remains unchanged.\n   163→\n   164→For each item in `source/`:\n   165→\n   166→1. **Check `.wsdignore`**: If item matches a `.wsdignore` entry, log skip and continue\n   167→2. **Check suspicious patterns**: If item matches a suspicious pattern, halt with error (these should not exist)\n   168→3. **Check symlink**: If item is a symlink, halt with error (symlinks are unexpected)\n   169→4. **Check empty directory**: If directory contains no files, halt with error (should have `.wsdkeep`)\n   170→\n   171→**Clarification on empty directories**: A directory containing only a `.wsdkeep` file is NOT empty—it contains a file. The empty directory check catches directories with zero files, which violates WSD conventions.\n   172→\n   173→**Contract**: The script MUST halt on any unexpected condition rather than silently proceeding. Because this validation happens before cleaning, any error leaves the target unchanged.\n   174→\n   175→#### Phase 4: Clean Target Directory\n   176→\n   177→After source validation passes, the target directory is cleaned:\n   178→\n   179→- Remove all files and directories EXCEPT `.git/`\n   180→- Log what was removed (file/directory count)\n   181→- Preserve `.git/` intact (maintains GitHub repository history)\n   182→\n   183→**Contract**: Cleaning is always performed. There is no incremental mode.\n   184→\n   185→#### Phase 5: Copy Files\n   186→\n   187→For each validated file (from Phase 3's staging list):\n   188→\n   189→1. Copy to target preserving relative path structure\n   190→2. Preserve file permissions (especially executable bits)\n   191→3. Log each file as staged\n   192→\n   193→**Guarantee**: File permissions MUST be preserved. Scripts with `+x` in `source/` MUST have `+x` in target.\n   194→\n   195→#### Phase 6: Verify Staging\n   196→\n   197→After copying, the script MUST verify:\n   198→\n   199→1. **File count**: Number of staged files equals the pre-validated staging list size\n   200→2. **Permissions**: Executable files retained their `+x` bit. The script compares against source file permissions to verify. Additionally, `wsd.json` contains a list of files that should be executable, which can serve as a reference.\n   201→\n   202→#### Phase 7: Generate Summary\n   203→\n   204→Report completion status including:\n   205→- Total files staged\n   206→- Total files excluded (with breakdown by reason)\n   207→- Verification results\n   208→- Next steps (git commands for publishing)\n   209→\n   210→### Prerequisite: Pre-Staging Script\n   211→\n   212→The Stage Release Script depends on `pre_staging.py` having been run first. The pre-staging script handles wsd.json metadata management including hash generation, executable list synchronization, and version bumping. The Stage Release Script copies the pre-staged `source/wsd.json` as-is to the target directory.\n   213→\n   214→For hash generation and wsd.json management details, see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md** and **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n   215→\n   216→### .wsdkeep File Handling\n   217→\n   218→.wsdkeep files are **NOT staged**. Although .wsdkeep files exist in `source/` as git placeholders to preserve empty directory structure, they are excluded from the staging process because directory requirements are tracked via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`.\n   219→\n   220→The staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\n   221→\n   222→**Design Rationale**: .wsdkeep files are structural git artifacts, not content files. The manifest declares semantic intent via `required_directories` (\"these directories must exist\"), and install/update operations generate .wsdkeep files locally based on directory state. See **Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files** for the complete .wsdkeep lifecycle.\n   223→\n   224→## Exclusion Pattern System\n   225→\n   226→### Built-in Suspicious File Patterns\n   227→\n   228→These patterns identify development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. If detected, the script MUST halt with an error (unless the file is listed in `.wsdignore`):\n   229→\n   230→| Pattern              | Description                            |\n   231→| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n   232→| `__pycache__/`       | Python bytecode cache directories      |\n   233→| `node_modules/`      | Node.js dependency directories         |\n   234→| `.git/`              | Git repository directories (in source) |\n   235→| `package-lock.json`  | npm lock files                         |\n   236→| `.package-lock.json` | npm hidden lock files                  |\n   237→| `.DS_Store`          | macOS metadata files                   |\n   238→| `desktop.ini`        | Windows metadata files                 |\n   239→| `Thumbs.db`          | Windows thumbnail cache                |\n   240→| `*~`                 | Vim backup files                       |\n   241→| `.*.swp`             | Vim swap files                         |\n   242→| `.*.swo`             | Vim swap files                         |\n   243→| `*.pyc`              | Python bytecode files                  |\n   244→| `*.pyo`              | Python optimized bytecode              |\n   245→| `dist/`              | Build distribution directories         |\n   246→| `build/`             | Build output directories               |\n   247→| `*.egg-info/`        | Python package metadata                |\n   248→\n   249→**Rationale**: These patterns are derived from the `/update-wsd-json` command's suspicious file detection logic, ensuring consistency across WSD Development tooling.\n   250→\n   251→### .wsdignore File Format\n   252→\n   253→The `source/.wsdignore` file lists files that legitimately exist in `source/` for WSD Development but should not be staged for distribution.\n   254→\n   255→**Current contents**:\n   256→```\n   257→.wsdignore\n   258→.envrc\n   259→```\n   260→\n   261→**Format rules**:\n   262→- One file path per line (relative to `source/`)\n   263→- Lines starting with `#` are comments\n   264→- Empty lines are ignored\n   265→- Patterns are matched exactly (no glob expansion)\n   266→\n   267→**Contract**: Files listed in `.wsdignore` are SKIPPED during staging, not treated as errors.\n   268→\n   269→### Exclusion Precedence\n   270→\n   271→1. Check against `.wsdignore` entries (skip if match)\n   272→2. Check against suspicious file patterns (error if match)\n   273→3. Proceed with staging\n   274→\n   275→This order allows `.wsdignore` to whitelist files that would otherwise be flagged as suspicious (though in practice, `.wsdignore` entries are specific to WSD Development, not general patterns).\n   276→\n   277→## Error Handling\n   278→\n   279→### Error Categories\n   280→\n   281→#### 1.

Symlink Errors\n   306→\n   307→**Error**: Symlink detected in source\n   308→\n   309→**Example Message**:\n   310→```\n   311→ERROR: Symlink detected in source/: source/scripts/link.py -> ../other.py\n   312→Symlinks are not expected in the WSD Runtime source.\n   313→Please investigate and resolve before staging.\n   314→```\n   315→\n   316→**Recovery**: Remove the symlink and replace with actual file, or determine why it was created.\n   317→\n   318→**Rationale**: Symlinks are unexpected in `source/` and may indicate accidental file creation or architectural issues.\n   319→\n   320→#### 3. Empty Directory Errors\n   321→\n   322→**Error**: Empty directory detected\n   323→\n   324→**Example Message**:\n   325→```\n   326→ERROR: Empty directory detected: source/docs/workbench/\n   327→Empty directories should contain a .wsdkeep file.\n   328→Please add .wsdkeep or remove the directory.\n   329→```\n   330→\n   331→**Recovery**: Add a `.wsdkeep` placeholder file to the directory, or remove the directory if it is not needed.\n   332→\n   333→**Rationale**: Empty directories should have `.wsdkeep` files to ensure they are tracked by git and preserved during installation.\n   334→\n   335→#### 4. Suspicious File Errors\n   336→\n   337→**Error**: Suspicious file detected\n   338→\n   339→**Example Message**:\n   340→```\n   341→ERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\n   342→Development artifacts should not exist in source/.\n   343→Please investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n   344→```\n   345→\n   346→**Recovery**: Remove the suspicious file/directory and investigate how it was created (may indicate a Rule 6.1 violation where code changes were made to `source/` instead of running from the development environment properly).\n   347→\n   348→### Error Recovery Principles\n   349→\n   350→**Guarantee**: Source validation (Phase 3) occurs BEFORE target modification (Phase 4). If any error is detected in `source/` (symlinks, empty directories, suspicious files), the target directory remains completely unchanged.\n   351→\n   352→If an error occurs during file copying (Phase 5), the target may be in an inconsistent state (cleaned but partially copied).

The staging directory (`../workscope-dev/` by default) serves as the GitHub publishing conduit for the public `rcgray/workscope-dev` repository, enabling clean separation between WSD Development and the distributed WSD Runtime.\n\nThis specification defines the complete staging process including file enumeration, exclusion filtering, target directory management, verification procedures, and error handling. The Stage Release Script is a prerequisite to the Build-System feature, which handles subsequent PyPI packaging from the staged files.\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Stage Release Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Stage Release Script serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a sanitized copy of WSD Runtime by filtering out development artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `.envrc`) that should not be distributed to end users\n\n2. **Git Separation**: Enables the GitHub publishing workflow by staging files to a separate repository (`../workscope-dev/`) with its own git history, preserving the `.git/` directory during staging operations\n\n3. **Source Purity Enforcement**: Validates that `source/` remains clean by halting on unexpected files (suspicious files, symlinks, empty directories), enforcing Design Decision 9 (Keep WSD Runtime Directory Pure and Ship-Ready)\n\n4. **Release Automation**: Provides a repeatable, idempotent process for preparing releases, eliminating manual file copying and the risk of accidentally shipping development artifacts\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and the `.wsdignore` file format.\n\n## Script Architecture\n\n### Script Location\n\nThe script lives at `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n\n- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools\n- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates on `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n\n### Command Interface\n\n```bash\n# Stage to default sibling directory (../workscope-dev/)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n\n# Preview what would be staged (no actual changes)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n\n# Stage to specific directory (for testing)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --target /path/to/target\n```\n\n### Behavioral Guarantees\n\n| Aspect            | Behavior                                |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Target default    | `../workscope-dev/` (sibling directory) |\n| Target override   | `--target /path/to/dir` flag            |\n| Verbosity         | Always verbose (lists all files)        |\n| Clean before copy | Always cleans target (except `.git/`)   |\n| Verification      | Always verifies after staging           |\n| Sync mode         | Full sync only (no incremental mode)    |\n| Git operations    | None (user handles git manually)        |\n| Target creation   | Never creates target (must exist)       |\n\n**Guarantee**: The script is idempotent. Running it twice in succession produces identical results in the target directory.\n\n## Staging Algorithm\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef stage_release(source_dir: Path, target_dir: Path, dry_run: bool = False) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stage WSD Runtime files from source to target directory.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to source/ directory\n        target_dir: Path to staging directory (e.g., ../workscope-dev/)\n        dry_run: If True, preview only without making changes\n\n    Raises:\n        FileNotFoundError: Target directory does not exist\n        ValueError: Source contains unexpected files (symlinks, empty dirs, suspicious files)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phase 1: Validation\n    validate_target_exists(target_dir)\n    validate_target_git_not_symlink(target_dir)  # .git/ must be real directory, not symlink\n    warn_if_no_git(target_dir)\n\n    # Phase 2: Load patterns\n    wsdignore_entries = load_wsdignore(source_dir)      # Files to skip quietly\n    suspicious_patterns = get_suspicious_patterns()     # Files that should not exist\n\n    # Phase 3: Pre-scan source for errors (before modifying target)\n    files_to_stage = []\n    for item in walk_source(source_dir):\n        # Check .wsdignore first (skip quietly)\n        if matches_wsdignore(item, wsdignore_entries):\n            log_skip(item, \"in .wsdignore\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check suspicious patterns (error - should not exist in source/)\n        if matches_suspicious_pattern(item, suspicious_patterns):\n            raise_suspicious_file_error(item)\n\n        # Check for symlinks (error - unexpected in source/)\n        if is_symlink(item):\n            raise_symlink_error(item)\n\n        # Check for empty directories (error - should have .wsdkeep)\n        if is_empty_directory(item):\n            raise_empty_directory_error(item)\n\n        # Validated - add to staging list\n        files_to_stage.append(item)\n\n    # Phase 4: Clean target directory (safe now - source validated)\n    clean_target(target_dir, preserve=[\".git\"], dry_run=dry_run)\n\n    # Phase 5: Copy files\n    staged_count = 0\n    for item in files_to_stage:\n        copy_with_permissions(item, target_dir, dry_run=dry_run)\n        log_stage(item)\n        staged_count += 1\n\n    # Phase 6: Verify staging\n    if not dry_run:\n        verify_staging(source_dir, target_dir, files_to_stage, staged_count)\n\n    # Phase 7: Generate summary report\n    generate_summary()\n```\n\n### Phase Details\n\n#### Phase 1: Validation\n\nThe script MUST validate preconditions before proceeding:\n\n1. **Target exists**: The target directory MUST exist. If not, the script MUST exit with a clear error message. The script MUST NOT create the target directory.\n\n2. **Git directory validation**: If the target contains `.git/`, it MUST be a real directory, not a symlink. If `.git/` is a symlink, the script MUST halt with an error.\n\n3. **Git warning**: If the target directory does not contain a `.git/` subdirectory, the script SHOULD warn the user (this may indicate incorrect target selection).\n\n#### Phase 2: Load Patterns\n\nTwo distinct pattern sets are loaded with different behaviors:\n\n1. **`.wsdignore` entries**: Files listed in `source/.wsdignore` that exist for WSD Development but should not ship. These are **skipped quietly** during staging.\n\n2. **Suspicious file patterns**: Built-in patterns identifying development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. These **cause an error** if detected.\n\nSee **Exclusion Pattern System** section for complete pattern list.\n\n#### Phase 3: Pre-scan Source for Errors\n\nBefore modifying the target directory, the script MUST validate all source files. This ensures that if any error is detected, the target remains unchanged.\n\nFor each item in `source/`:\n\n1. **Check `.wsdignore`**: If item matches a `.wsdignore` entry, log skip and continue\n2. **Check suspicious patterns**: If item matches a suspicious pattern, halt with error (these should not exist)\n3. **Check symlink**: If item is a symlink, halt with error (symlinks are unexpected)\n4. **Check empty directory**: If directory contains no files, halt with error (should have `.wsdkeep`)\n\n**Clarification on empty directories**: A directory containing only a `.wsdkeep` file is NOT empty—it contains a file. The empty directory check catches directories with zero files, which violates WSD conventions.\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST halt on any unexpected condition rather than silently proceeding. Because this validation happens before cleaning, any error leaves the target unchanged.\n\n#### Phase 4: Clean Target Directory\n\nAfter source validation passes, the target directory is cleaned:\n\n- Remove all files and directories EXCEPT `.git/`\n- Log what was removed (file/directory count)\n- Preserve `.git/` intact (maintains GitHub repository history)\n\n**Contract**: Cleaning is always performed. There is no incremental mode.\n\n#### Phase 5: Copy Files\n\nFor each validated file (from Phase 3's staging list):\n\n1. Copy to target preserving relative path structure\n2. Preserve file permissions (especially executable bits)\n3. Log each file as staged\n\n**Guarantee**: File permissions MUST be preserved. Scripts with `+x` in `source/` MUST have `+x` in target.\n\n#### Phase 6: Verify Staging\n\nAfter copying, the script MUST verify:\n\n1. **File count**: Number of staged files equals the pre-validated staging list size\n2. **Permissions**: Executable files retained their `+x` bit. The script compares against source file permissions to verify. Additionally, `wsd.json` contains a list of files that should be executable, which can serve as a reference.\n\n#### Phase 7: Generate Summary\n\nReport completion status including:\n- Total files staged\n- Total files excluded (with breakdown by reason)\n- Verification results\n- Next steps (git commands for publishing)\n\n### Prerequisite: Pre-Staging Script\n\nThe Stage Release Script depends on `pre_staging.py` having been run first. The pre-staging script handles wsd.json metadata management including hash generation, executable list synchronization, and version bumping. The Stage Release Script copies the pre-staged `source/wsd.json` as-is to the target directory.\n\nFor hash generation and wsd.json management details, see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md** and **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n### .wsdkeep File Handling\n\n.wsdkeep files are **NOT staged**. Although .wsdkeep files exist in `source/` as git placeholders to preserve empty directory structure, they are excluded from the staging process because directory requirements are tracked via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`.\n\nThe staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\n\n**Design Rationale**: .wsdkeep files are structural git artifacts, not content files. The manifest declares semantic intent via `required_directories` (\"these directories must exist\"), and install/update operations generate .wsdkeep files locally based on directory state. See **Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files** for the complete .wsdkeep lifecycle.\n\n## Exclusion Pattern System\n\n### Built-in Suspicious File Patterns\n\nThese patterns identify development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. If detected, the script MUST halt with an error (unless the file is listed in `.wsdignore`):\n\n| Pattern              | Description                            |\n| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| `__pycache__/`       | Python bytecode cache directories      |\n| `node_modules/`      | Node.js dependency directories         |\n| `.git/`              | Git repository directories (in source) |\n| `package-lock.json`  | npm lock files                         |\n| `.package-lock.json` | npm hidden lock files                  |\n| `.DS_Store`          | macOS metadata files                   |\n| `desktop.ini`        | Windows metadata files                 |\n| `Thumbs.db`          | Windows thumbnail cache                |\n| `*~`                 | Vim backup files                       |\n| `.*.swp`             | Vim swap files                         |\n| `.*.swo`             | Vim swap files                         |\n| `*.pyc`              | Python bytecode files                  |\n| `*.pyo`              | Python optimized bytecode              |\n| `dist/`              | Build distribution directories         |\n| `build/`             | Build output directories               |\n| `*.egg-info/`        | Python package metadata                |\n\n**Rationale**: These patterns are derived from the `/update-wsd-json` command's suspicious file detection logic, ensuring consistency across WSD Development tooling.\n\n### .wsdignore File Format\n\nThe `source/.wsdignore` file lists files that legitimately exist in `source/` for WSD Development but should not be staged for distribution.\n\n**Current contents**:\n```\n.wsdignore\n.envrc\n```\n\n**Format rules**:\n- One file path per line (relative to `source/`)\n- Lines starting with `#` are comments\n- Empty lines are ignored\n- Patterns are matched exactly (no glob expansion)\n\n**Contract**: Files listed in `.wsdignore` are SKIPPED during staging, not treated as errors.\n\n### Exclusion Precedence\n\n1. Check against `.wsdignore` entries (skip if match)\n2. Check against suspicious file patterns (error if match)\n3. Proceed with staging\n\nThis order allows `.wsdignore` to whitelist files that would otherwise be flagged as suspicious (though in practice, `.wsdignore` entries are specific to WSD Development, not general patterns).\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Target Directory Errors\n\n**Error**: Target directory does not exist\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Target directory does not exist: ../workscope-dev/\nThis directory should be the GitHub repository for rcgray/workscope-dev.\nPlease ensure the repository is cloned to the expected location.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Clone the GitHub repository to the expected location, or use `--target` to specify a different location.\n\n**Error**: Target `.git/` is a symlink\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Target .git/ is a symlink: ../workscope-dev/.git -> /other/repo/.git\nThe .git directory must be a real directory, not a symlink.\nThis may indicate a git worktree or other non-standard setup.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Use a standard git clone for the target repository, or use `--target` to specify a different location.\n\n#### 2. Symlink Errors\n\n**Error**: Symlink detected in source\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Symlink detected in source/: source/scripts/link.py -> ../other.py\nSymlinks are not expected in the WSD Runtime source.\nPlease investigate and resolve before staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Remove the symlink and replace with actual file, or determine why it was created.\n\n**Rationale**: Symlinks are unexpected in `source/` and may indicate accidental file creation or architectural issues.\n\n#### 3. Empty Directory Errors\n\n**Error**: Empty directory detected\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Empty directory detected: source/docs/workbench/\nEmpty directories should contain a .wsdkeep file.\nPlease add .wsdkeep or remove the directory.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Add a `.wsdkeep` placeholder file to the directory, or remove the directory if it is not needed.\n\n**Rationale**: Empty directories should have `.wsdkeep` files to ensure they are tracked by git and preserved during installation.\n\n#### 4. Suspicious File Errors\n\n**Error**: Suspicious file detected\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\nDevelopment artifacts should not exist in source/.\nPlease investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Remove the suspicious file/directory and investigate how it was created (may indicate a Rule 6.1 violation where code changes were made to `source/` instead of running from the development environment properly).\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: Source validation (Phase 3) occurs BEFORE target modification (Phase 4). If any error is detected in `source/` (symlinks, empty directories, suspicious files), the target directory remains completely unchanged.\n\nIf an error occurs during file copying (Phase 5), the target may be in an inconsistent state (cleaned but partially copied). The error message will indicate this.\n\n**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The clean-before-copy behavior ensures the target will be in a consistent state after a successful run.\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe script MUST use Python standard library only:\n- `pathlib` - Path operations\n- `shutil` - File copying with permission preservation\n- `os` - Directory operations\n- `argparse` - Command-line parsing\n\n**Contract**: No external packages required. The script runs with Python 3.10+ (matching WSD requirements).\n\n### Permission Handling\n\nThe script MUST use `shutil.copy2()` for file copying, which preserves file metadata including permission bits.\n\n**Verification**: After staging, the script MUST verify that executable files (those with `+x` in source) retain their executable permission in the target.\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Staging Tests\n\n1. **Default Target Staging**: Run `uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py`, verify files appear in `../workscope-dev/`, verify `.git/` preserved, verify excluded files not present\n\n2. **Custom Target Staging**: Run with `--target /tmp/test-staging`, verify files staged to specified location\n\n3. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no files changed, verify output shows what would be staged\n\n4. **Idempotency**: Run script twice in succession, verify target directory identical after both runs\n\n### Edge Case Tests\n\n1. **Missing Target Directory**: Run against non-existent target, verify clear error message, verify no partial operations\n\n2. **Target Without .git**: Run against valid directory without `.git/`, verify warning displayed but staging proceeds\n\n3. **Empty .wsdignore**: Remove all entries from `.wsdignore`, run staging, verify default exclusions still apply\n\n4. **Symlink Detection**: Create symlink in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n\n5. **Empty Directory Detection**: Create empty directory in `source/` (without `.wsdkeep`), run staging, verify error and halt\n\n6. **Suspicious File Detection**: Create `__pycache__/` in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Release Workflow**: Stage files, then run `build_for_pypi.py` on staged output, verify build succeeds\n\n2. **Permission Preservation**: Stage files including executable scripts, verify `+x` bit preserved on `wsd.py` and scripts\n\n3. **File Count Verification**: Count files in `source/`, count exclusions, verify staged count matches expected\n\n4. **Git Workflow Integration**: Stage files, navigate to target, run `git status`, verify correct files shown as added/modified/deleted\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Standard Staging Operation\n\n**Context**: Developer wants to prepare a release for GitHub publishing.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nCleaning target directory...\n  Preserved: .git/\n  Removed: 127 files, 23 directories\n\nStaging files...\n  STAGE: wsd.py\n  STAGE: wsd.json\n  STAGE: scripts/health_check.py\n  STAGE: scripts/wsd_utils.py\n  SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n  SKIP: .wsdignore (in .wsdignore)\n  STAGE: .claude/agents/task-master.md\n  ...\n\nVerifying staging...\n  File count: 127 staged (2 excluded) - OK\n  Permissions: 8 executable files verified - OK\n\n=== Staging Complete ===\nStaged 127 files to ../workscope-dev/\nNext steps:\n  cd ../workscope-dev\n  git status\n  git add -A && git commit -m \"Release vX.Y.Z\"\n  git push origin main\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The script cleaned the target (preserving `.git/`), copied all source files except those in `.wsdignore`, verified the result, and provided next steps for the developer.\n\n### Example 2: Dry Run Preview\n\n**Context**: Developer wants to see what would be staged without making changes.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging (DRY RUN) ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nPre-scanning source...\n  127 files to stage, 2 to skip\n\nWould clean target directory...\n  Would preserve: .git/\n  Would remove: 127 files, 23 directories\n\nWould stage files...\n  WOULD STAGE: wsd.py\n  WOULD STAGE: wsd.json\n  WOULD SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n  ...\n\n=== Dry Run Complete ===\nNo changes made. Run without --dry-run to perform staging.\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The dry run pre-scans the source to determine exact counts, then shows exactly what would happen without making any changes. This allows the developer to verify before committing to the operation.\n\n### Example 3: Error Scenario - Suspicious File\n\n**Context**: Developer accidentally ran a Python command that created `__pycache__/` in `source/`.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nPre-scanning source...\n\nERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\nDevelopment artifacts should not exist in source/.\nPlease investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The script detected a `__pycache__/` directory during pre-scan (before modifying the target). The target directory remains unchanged. The developer must investigate and remove the artifact before staging can proceed.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Release Managers\n\n1. **Always verify git status after staging**: Run `cd ../workscope-dev && git status` to see exactly what changed before committing.\n\n2. **Review diff for unexpected changes**: Run `git diff` in the staging directory to verify no unintended modifications.\n\n3. **Test dry-run first for major releases**: Use `--dry-run` to preview the staging operation, especially after significant changes to `source/`.\n\n4. **Maintain clean source directory**: Ensure `source/` remains free of development artifacts per Design Decision 9.\n\n### For Developers\n\n1. **Use proper development environment**: Run WSD from the development root, not from within `source/`, to avoid creating artifacts.\n\n2. **Keep .wsdignore minimal**: Only add files that genuinely need to exist in `source/` for development purposes.\n\n3. **Address errors immediately**: If the script halts on a suspicious file, investigate the root cause rather than working around it.\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Describes the pre-staging script that must run before staging to prepare wsd.json with hashes, executable list, and version\n- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Describes PyPI packaging that consumes the staged output; the staging script is a prerequisite to the build process\n- **Design-Decisions.md § Decision 9**: Establishes the principle of keeping WSD Runtime directory pure and ship-ready, which this script enforces\n- **Install-And-Update-Overview.md**: Describes installation behavior that the staged files will exhibit when distributed\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm and format specification\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Schema for wsd.json including file_hashes field\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Stage Release Script including the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and error handling.

During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n   173→\n   174→**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n   175→\n   176→### required_directories\n   177→\n   178→**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n   179→**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n   180→**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n   181→\n   182→**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n   183→\n   184→**How It Works**:\n   185→- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n   186→- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n   187→- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n   188→- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n   189→\n   190→**Path Requirements**:\n   191→- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n   192→- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n   193→- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n   194→- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n   195→\n   196→**Why This Design**:\n   197→- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n   198→- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n   199→- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n   200→- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n   201→\n   202→**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n   203→\n   204→## Key Concepts\n   205→\n   206→**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest. See Update-System.md for policy application details.\n   207→\n   208→**Installation Exclusion**: Files declared in the installation_only array are never copied during installation. See Installation-System.md for exclusion rule details and rationale.\n   209→\n   210→## Complete Examples\n   211→\n   212→### Example 1: Minimal wsd.json\n   213→\n   214→**Use Case**: Early WSD version with no protected files and minimal executable scripts\n   215→\n   216→```json\n   217→{\n   218→  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n   219→}\n   220→```\n   221→\n   222→**Analysis**:\n   223→- Only version declared (required field)\n   224→- installation_only defaults to empty array (no installation exclusions)\n   225→- no_overwrite defaults to empty array (no protected files)\n   226→- executable defaults to empty array (no executable files)\n   227→- Valid but minimal\n   228→\n   229→**Note**: This is valid but impractical.

This specification defines the authoritative schema for wsd.json structure and field semantics.\n\nFor how wsd.json is used during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md respectively.\n\n## File Location\n\n**File Name**: `wsd.json`\n**Location**: WSD Runtime root directory\n**Format**: JSON (UTF-8 encoded)\n**Distribution**: NOT copied during installation (see Installation-System.md for exclusion rule details)\n\n## JSON Schema\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"title\": \"WSD Runtime Metadata\",\n    \"description\": \"Metadata file declaring WSD Runtime version and policies\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"required\": [\"version\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"version\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Semantic version of this WSD Runtime release (e.g., '1.0.0')\",\n            \"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+$\"\n        },\n        \"installation_only\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Files required for installation operations but not copied to destination\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        },\n        \"no_overwrite\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Files protected from being overwritten during updates\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        },\n        \"executable\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Files requiring executable (+x) permission\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        },\n        \"file_hashes\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"description\": \"SHA-256 content hashes for files in WSD Runtime\",\n            \"additionalProperties\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"pattern\": \"^sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}$\"\n            },\n            \"default\": {}\n        },\n        \"required_directories\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Directories that must exist in the target project\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        }\n    },\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\n```\n\n## Field Specifications\n\n### version\n\n**Type**: String (semantic version: `major.minor.patch`)\n**Required**: Yes\n**Pattern**: `^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$`\n**Example**: `\"1.2.3\"`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares the WSD Runtime release version for tracking and compatibility checks.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Must match semantic version pattern\n- Incremented per semantic versioning rules (major.minor.patch)\n\n### installation_only\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"wsd.json\", \".DS_Store\", \"build-templates.py\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files are required for installation operations but should not be copied to the destination project during installation.\n\n**Usage**: Files that are needed by the WSD Runtime source to perform installations/updates but serve no purpose once WSD is integrated into a user's project. Common examples include wsd.json itself (which contains installation metadata but has no operational role in the destination) and system files like .DS_Store.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Files do NOT need to exist in WSD Runtime (they may be generated at build time)\n\n**Note**: Unlike no_overwrite and executable arrays, installation_only paths are not validated for existence. This allows declaring build-time generated files (e.g., `__init__.py` for PyPI packages) that should be excluded from installation. For exclusion mechanism implementation, see Installation-System.md § File Copying Process and the FIP in Install-And-Update-Overview.md.\n\n### no_overwrite\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files should never be overwritten during updates when they exist in target.\n\n**Usage**: Files where user customization IS the primary purpose (like Action-Plan.md which IS the user's project plan). For files with customizable sections, use WORKSCOPE-DEV tags instead.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n\n**Note**: For policy behavior during updates and distinction from WORKSCOPE-DEV tags, see Update-System.md and Template-System.md § File Protection.\n\n### executable\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"scripts/health_check.py\", \"wsd.py\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files require executable (+x) permission.\n\n**Why Needed**: Distribution mechanisms (ZIP, web fetch) may not preserve file permissions. Explicit declaration ensures scripts remain executable.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n\n**Note**: For permission application details and conservative approach rationale, see Template-System.md § File Permission Model.\n\n### file_hashes\n\n**Type**: Object (dictionary mapping relative paths to hash strings)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty object)\n**Example**:\n```json\n{\n    \".claude/agents/task-master.md\": \"sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:abc123def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\"\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Stores pre-computed SHA-256 content hashes for files in WSD Runtime. These hashes enable accurate file comparison during install and update operations by comparing target file content against known source content.\n\n**Hash Format**: Each hash value follows the format `sha256:<hex_digest>` where:\n- `sha256` is the algorithm prefix (for future-proofing)\n- `:` is a separator character\n- `<hex_digest>` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (256 bits / 4 bits per hex char)\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Keys are relative paths from WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n- Must match the path format used elsewhere in wsd.json\n\n**Which Files Are Hashed**:\n- All files that are copied during installation receive hashes\n- Files listed in the `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (they are not copied to destination)\n- The `.wsdignore` file (if present) is NOT hashed (excluded from staging)\n\n**Usage**: Hashes are generated during the pre-staging process by `pre_staging.py` and written to wsd.json before distribution. During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n\n**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n\n### required_directories\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n\n**How It Works**:\n- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n\n**Why This Design**:\n- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n\n**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest. See Update-System.md for policy application details.\n\n**Installation Exclusion**: Files declared in the installation_only array are never copied during installation. See Installation-System.md for exclusion rule details and rationale.\n\n## Complete Examples\n\n### Example 1: Minimal wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Early WSD version with no protected files and minimal executable scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Only version declared (required field)\n- installation_only defaults to empty array (no installation exclusions)\n- no_overwrite defaults to empty array (no protected files)\n- executable defaults to empty array (no executable files)\n- Valid but minimal\n\n**Note**: This is valid but impractical. Real WSD installations typically need executable scripts, installation exclusions, and may protect user-owned files.\n\n### Example 2: Typical wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Standard WSD Runtime with protection for user-owned files and executable scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"installation_only\": [\n    \"wsd.json\"\n  ],\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\"\n  ],\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\": \"sha256:b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcde\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\": \"sha256:c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Version declared: v1.0.0\n- One installation exclusion: wsd.json (not copied to destination)\n- Three protected files: user's Action Plan, PRD, and Developer Notes\n- Three executable scripts: health check, journal init, file protection hook\n- Content hashes for files that are copied during installation\n- Represents common WSD configuration\n\n### Example 3: Comprehensive wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Mature WSD Runtime with multiple protected files, extensive script collection, custom installation-only files, and content hashes\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"installation_only\": [\n    \"wsd.json\",\n    \".DS_Store\",\n    \"build-templates.py\",\n    \"DISTRIBUTION-NOTES.md\"\n  ],\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\",\n    \"config/local-settings.json\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.js\",\n    \"scripts/update_docs.py\",\n    \"scripts/file_list.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \"scripts/archive_claude_sessions.py\",\n    \"scripts/new_prompt.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_pdoc.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_python.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_typedoc.js\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_typescript.js\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\",\n    \"wsd.py\"\n  ],\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.js\": \"sha256:b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcde\",\n    \"wsd.py\": \"sha256:c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\": \"sha256:d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef01\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Version: v1.2.5 (mature release with patch updates)\n- Four installation exclusions: wsd.json, .DS_Store, build script, and distribution notes (not copied to user projects)\n- Four protected files: Action Plan, PRD, Developer Notes, and local settings (user's core documents)\n- Comprehensive executable list: all scripts requiring direct execution\n- Content hashes for installed files enabling accurate update detection\n- Includes both Python and TypeScript/JavaScript scripts (language-agnostic WSD)\n- wsd.py itself declared executable (can run as `./wsd.py`)\n\n\n## Validation Rules\n\n**Structural Requirements**:\n- version field required and must match semantic version pattern\n- installation_only, no_overwrite, executable, file_hashes, and required_directories are optional\n- Array fields default to empty arrays;

The pre-staging script moves this work earlier so all wsd.json modifications happen in `source/` and are captured by git.\n\n## Pre-Staging Algorithm\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef pre_staging(source_dir: Path, dry_run: bool = False, verbose: bool = False) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate and update source/wsd.json with hashes, executable list, and version.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to source/ directory\n        dry_run: If True, preview only without making changes\n        verbose: If True, display detailed progress\n\n    Raises:\n        SystemExit: On validation failure or I/O error\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phase 1: Load current wsd.json\n    wsd_json = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    original_state = deep_copy(wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 2: Collect valid files\n    files = collect_wsd_files(source_dir)\n\n    # Phase 2.5: Extract required_directories from .wsdkeep files\n    wsd_json['required_directories'] = extract_required_directories(files)\n    validate_required_directories(wsd_json['required_directories'], files, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 3: Validate metadata arrays\n    validate_no_overwrite_exists(wsd_json, files, verbose)\n    validate_installation_only_exists(wsd_json, verbose)\n    validate_executable_exists(wsd_json, files, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 4: Sync executable list from actual permissions\n    wsd_json['executable'] = sync_executable_list(files, source_dir, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 5: Generate file hashes (excluding installation_only and .wsdkeep)\n    installation_only = set(wsd_json.get('installation_only', []))\n    wsd_json['file_hashes'] = generate_file_hashes(files, source_dir, installation_only)\n\n    # Phase 5.5: Validate manifest exclusivity\n    validate_manifest_exclusivity(wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 6: Check for changes and bump version if needed\n    if has_changes(original_state, wsd_json):","numLines":150,"startLine":1,"totalLines":933}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"8cc234ec-8fbe-45ba-a852-f3779a7b8541"}

Let me provide my assessment.\n\n---\n\n## Manifest-Driven Pipeline Specification Review\n\nI've thoroughly reviewed the specification and cross-referenced it with related documents, existing code, and design decisions. Here are my findings:\n\n### Findings\n\n**1. Inconsistency: Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md already describes manifest-based file list retrieval**\n\nThe Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md (lines 218-222) states:\n> \"The staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\"\n\nHowever, the actual `stage_release.py` implementation (line 570) still uses `collect_wsd_files()`:\n```python\nrelative_files = collect_wsd_files(source_dir)\n```\n\nThis suggests Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md was already updated as part of Phase 4.1 (`[%]` tasks), but the code changes in Phase 1 were not actually implemented. **The documentation is ahead of the implementation.**\n\n**2. Phase 4.1 is marked `[%]` but the actual code change (Phase 1) is `[ ]`**\n\nPhase 4.1.1-4.1.2 are marked `[%]` (needs validation), suggesting prior work exists. But if Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md was updated to describe manifest-based retrieval, and the actual code in `stage_release.py` still uses `collect_wsd_files()`, then:\n- Either the Phase 1 code changes were never implemented\n- Or the Phase 4 documentation updates are premature/out of order\n\n**This needs clarification**: Did prior work actually update the Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md documentation before implementing the code changes? If so, the FIP phases are out of sequence.\n\n**3. Missing detail: What should happen when `load_wsd_metadata()` fails in stage_release.py?**\n\nThe spec says pipeline stages should fail with \"clear error message\" when manifest is missing. However, the current `load_wsd_metadata()` in `stage_release.py` (lines 311-332) returns an empty dict `{}` on failure, not raising an error. \n\nThe spec's \"Error Handling\" section (lines 139-206) describes specific error messages, but doesn't clarify whether `stage_release.py` should:\n- Call the existing `load_wsd_metadata()` (which returns `{}` on failure)\n- Create a new function that raises errors\n- Modify the existing function\n\n**Recommendation**: The spec should specify which function to use for manifest loading and whether failure behavior needs to change.\n\n**4. Phase 3.1.4 validation location conflict**\n\nPhase 3.1.4 states:\n> \"Add validation in `read_wsd_metadata()` that `file_hashes` is non-empty\"\n\nBut `read_wsd_metadata()` is in `source/wsd.py` (the WSD Runtime), not in `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`. \n\nThe spec's \"Manifest Trust Model\" section says stages should NOT validate file existence. But Phase 3.1.4 adds validation for non-empty `file_hashes`. \n\n**Clarification needed**: Is this validation supposed to be:\n- In `source/wsd.py`'s `read_wsd_metadata()` (affects install/update operations)\n- In each pipeline stage's manifest loading code\n- A universal validation that happens everywhere\n\n**5. `load_wsd_metadata()` vs `read_wsd_metadata()` naming confusion**\n\nThe spec uses both names inconsistently:\n- Line 76: `metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)` for install/update\n- Line 75: `metadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)` for staging/build\n\nThe actual code has:\n- `read_wsd_metadata()` in `source/wsd.py` - returns `WsdMetadata` dataclass\n- `load_wsd_metadata()` in `stage_release.py` - returns raw dict, silently returns `{}` on failure\n\n**Recommendation**: Clarify which functions should be used where, or note that new functions will need to be created.\n\n**6. Missing test file reference in Phase 2.2**\n\nPhase 2.2.2 mentions `tests/test_build_package_integration.py`, but Phase 2.2.1 only mentions `tests/test_build_package.py`. The spec should clarify what distinct test scenarios go in each file.\n\n**7. Potential issue: `.wsdkeep` filtering discrepancy**\n\nThe spec says `file_hashes.keys()` is the canonical list and `.wsdkeep` files are excluded. However:\n- `collect_wsd_files()` INCLUDES `.wsdkeep` files in its output\n- The current code in `detect_collisions()` (line 3883-3884) manually filters out `.wsdkeep`:\n  ```python\n  source_files = [p for p in all_source_files if str(p) not in installation_only_set and p.name != \".wsdkeep\"]\n  ```\n\nWhen switching to manifest-based retrieval, this filtering becomes automatic (since `file_hashes` doesn't include `.wsdkeep`). **The spec should explicitly note that the manual `.wsdkeep` filtering code should be removed** when switching to `file_hashes.keys()`, not just \"remove `collect_wsd_files()` call.\"\n\n**8. Phase 5.3 Integration verification - unclear scope**\n\nPhase 5.3.1 says:\n> \"Run full pipeline in temp dirs: `pre_staging.py` -> `stage_release.py` -> `build_package.py`\"\n\nBut `pre_staging.py` modifies `source/wsd.json`. Running in \"temp dirs\" would require copying `source/` to a temp location first, running pre_staging there, then running the rest of the pipeline. **The spec should clarify the test setup for this integration test.**\n\n**9. Missing consideration: What if `file_hashes` is populated but `installation_only` is missing from manifest?**\n\nThe error handling section covers:\n- Missing `wsd.json`\n- Missing `file_hashes` field\n- Empty `file_hashes`\n\nBut doesn't cover:\n- Missing `installation_only` field (needed for stageable file list calculation)\n\n**Recommendation**: Add error handling guidance for missing `installation_only`.\n\n**10. Spec drift: Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md references this feature as already implemented**\n\nLines 218-222 in Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md describe manifest-based file list retrieval as current behavior. If Phase 4.1 documentation updates completed first (explaining the `[%]` state), this creates documentation that doesn't match reality.\n\n**Recommendation**: Either revert Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md to describe `collect_wsd_files()` behavior until Phase 1 is complete, or acknowledge this is intentional \"documentation-first\" approach.\n\n---\n\nShall we discuss these findings?

The PRD was already in the system context at the start (shown in the first system-reminder)\n2. When I ran `/wsd:boot`, the skill loaded and the system-reminders showed the actual file contents for:\n   - Agent-System.md\n   - Agent-Rules.md\n   - Design-Decisions.md\n   - Documentation-System.md\n   - Checkboxlist-System.md\n   - Workscope-System.md\n\n3. For my `/refine-plan` investigation, I used Read tool calls and got actual content back:\n   - Manifest-Driven-Pipeline-Overview.md - got full content (lines 1-390)\n   - stage_release.py - got full content (lines 1-613)\n   - build_package.py - got full content (lines 1-964)\n   - source/wsd.py sections - got content with line numbers\n   - Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md - got full content (lines 1-627)\n   - WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md - got full content (lines 1-364)\n   - Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md - got partial content (lines 1-150)\n   - wsd_utils.py sections - got content\n\nLooking at the function results in my conversation, I can see actual file contents with line numbers were returned, not `<persisted-output>` placeholders.\n\nFor example, when I read Manifest-Driven-Pipeline-Overview.md, I got back:\n```\n     1→# Manifest-Driven Pipeline Specification\n     2→\n     3→**Version:** 1.1.0\n\n\n```\n\nThis is actual file content, not a persisted-output reference. Every Read tool invocation throughout my session returned genuine file data with line numbers that I could work with and analyze, so I didn't encounter the phantom read problem.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":126940,"cache_read_input_tokens":21739,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":126940,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXK4czosQU897tKnD6Ckm","type":"assistant","uuid":"b913d2d3-10e0-4f4f-8b72-5ddfb0848fda","timestamp":"2026-01-20T17:58:10.365Z"}
