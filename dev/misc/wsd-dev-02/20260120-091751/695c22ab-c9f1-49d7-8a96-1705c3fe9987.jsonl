The name of this project is Workscope-Dev (https://workscope.dev), often abbreviated \"WSD\". It is a collection of templates, agent definitions, rule systems, and developer scripts that make working with AI Assistants more efficient.\n\nOur goal is different than typical Python projects that aim to build a package. Instead, we are building an orchestration system, and our deliverable is a set of files that exist in the `source/` directory of this repository. We refer to the deliverable directory internally as the \"WSD Runtime\" and it is what will eventually ship to end-users. This repository around the WSD Runtime is referred to (internally) as the WSD Development project, and end-users will not have access to it. To further complicate things, the WSD Development project _uses_ WSD in its endeavors to create the WSD Runtime, so there are places where you will see duplicate files (e.g., `wsd.py` and `source/wsd.py`). Files inside the `source/` directory are the product we ship; files outside the `source/` directory are where we are using the product we ship (a WSD installation) to further develop the product (files in the `source/` directory).\n\nYou should read the following key project files before you begin work:\n- `docs/core/PRD.md` ( @docs/core/PRD.md )\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\nFirst Directive: Print a message acknowledging that you read the content in the `wsd-init-project-introduction` section immediately above and followed all directions therein.\n\n## Workscope System\n\nRun the `/wsd:boot` command to read the necessary files for understanding the Workscope-Dev Platform. When it is complete, return here and finish the remaining instructions.\n\n## Workscope ID Generation\n\nGenerate a unique Workscope ID for this session based on the current timestamp:\n\n1. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp\n2. Report your Workscope ID, which is derived from this timestamp according to the pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n\n**Remember this Workscope ID** as you will use it throughout your session for:\n- Work Journal naming\n- Workscope file naming (if fetching from Task-Master)\n- All agent communications\n\n## Work Journal\n\nYour next preparation task is to start a new \"Work Journal\" for YOUR fresh session with the Workscope ID:\n\n**CRITICAL - Work Journal in Archive Location:**\n\nRun the Work Journal initialization script, substituting your Workscope ID in the command below. Note that `[Workscope ID]` is strictly the `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` identifier, with no added prefix or suffix:\n\n(bash):\n   bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh \"[Workscope ID]\"\n\nThis script will create a new Work Journal directly in the archive location at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`. Verify that this file exists and was properly formed (with the correct filename).\n\nThis file is now YOUR \"Work Journal,\" and you will be continually adding to it over the course of YOUR session as you proceed through your workscope. Be sure to update your Work Journal after each step so this real time monitoring can take place.\n\n**CRITICAL**: `cat >> file << EOF` IS FORBIDDEN. It is an anti-pattern that will likely result in full rejection of your contributions. Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`) to write to files. Use your standard tools (e.g., Read, Edit, etc.) to interact with files throughout your session. You will be reminded of this as **Rule 4.4** in the Agent Rules.\n\n## Task-Master Assignment (Conditional)\n\n**IF `$1` is `--custom`:**\n- Run the `/wsd:onboard` command and return to this command\n- Skip the rest of this section and continue to \"## Completion Behavior\"\n- You will receive your workscope directly from the User after this command completes\n\n**OTHERWISE (including if `$1` is empty):**\n- Consult @agent-task-master to fetch your workscope assignment\n- Provide the Task-Master with your Workscope ID that you generated earlier\n- Workscope directive (forward to Task-Master if provided): $1\n\nThe Task-Master has complete instructions in its definition and will:\n  - Create a workscope file at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`\n  - Mark the selected tasks with `[*]` in the relevant checkboxlists\n  - Return the workscope file path to you\n\nRead the workscope file. **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Your workscope will assign SPECIFIC TASK NUMBERS (e.g., \"3.5, 3.6, 3.7\") for execution. While you should understand the entire phase as context for how your tasks fit into the larger picture, you are responsible for EXECUTING only your assigned task numbers.\n\nMANDATORY: After reading your workscope file, literally copy the ENTIRE, VERBATIM content of the workscope document into the Work Journal. Do this before moving on to the next step. The User will read your Work Journal, and if the User does not see the exact, verbatim text of your workscope file present in the Work Journal after it was assigned to you by the Task-Master agent, your entire session will be immediately terminated.\n\n### Phase Inventory Validation\n\nBefore accepting, check the Phase Inventory for this error: \"CLEAR (all [%])\" or any \"CLEAR\" with a qualifier. Phases with `[%]` items are NOT CLEAR.\n\nIf you detect this error: Reject the workscope. Tell Task-Master to delete the invalid workscope file and redo the assignment correctly. This is the one exception to workscope immutability—an invalid workscope must be replaced.\n\n## Completion Behavior\n\nUpon completing the initialization steps above, return to the User with a clear message at the END of your reply.\n\nMANDATORY: Put the following text at the END of your reply, verbatim:\n**\"WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: propose changes, describe the workscope, or `/wsd:prepare`. To abandon completely, `/wsd:abort`.\"**\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe command should handle these error conditions:\n\n1. **Agent communication failures**: Retry agent communications if they fail\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --custom"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"14254e2e-53f5-42e2-bc85-ddfadef59f75","timestamp":"2026-01-20T17:17:31.632Z"}

Let me give you the critical information you need to succeed.\n\n---\n\n## MANDATORY ONBOARDING FOR USER AGENT (Workscope ID: 20260120-091751)\n\nWelcome to the WSD Development project. I am the Project-Bootstrapper, and my job is to ensure you understand ALL expectations, rules, and standards BEFORE you begin any work. This prevents your work from being rejected later by other Special Agents.\n\n### PHASE 1: MANDATORY RULES - READ IMMEDIATELY\n\nYou **MUST** read the following file in its entirety. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Breaking ANY rule in this document will result in COMPLETE REJECTION of your work:\n\n**`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`**\n\nI have already read this file. Here are the THREE MOST VIOLATED rules that you need to burn into your memory:\n\n#### ⚠️ RULE 5.1 - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (Most Frequently Violated)\n**THIS APP HAS NOT SHIPPED YET.** When making changes:\n- DO NOT include migration-based solutions\n- DO NOT maintain \"backward compatibility\" \n- DO NOT provide \"legacy support\"\n- DO NOT add migration notes even in documentation\n- **VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE REJECTION** - The Rules-Enforcer is instructed to reject your FULL submission if you violate this\n\n#### ⚠️ RULE 3.4 - NO META-PROCESS REFERENCES IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS (Second Most Violated)\nDo NOT include meta-process references in **product artifacts** (source code, tests, scripts):\n- ❌ BAD: `# Extracted from cli.py during Phase 2 refactoring`\n- ❌ BAD: `# Logs warnings for malformed tags (task 2.5.4)`\n- ❌ BAD: `\"\"\"Test for Phase 3 authentication feature\"\"\"`\n- ❌ BAD: `// Fixed null pointer (see ticket #47)`\n\n**Note:** This rule does NOT apply to process documents (Feature specs, tickets, Action Plans) - those SHOULD have phase numbers and task references.\n\n#### ⚠️ RULE 3.11 - WRITE ACCESS BLOCKED? USE WORKBENCH\nIf you need to edit a file in a read-only directory (`docs/read-only/`, `.claude/`, etc.):\n1. Copy the file to `docs/workbench/` keeping the EXACT same filename\n2. Make your edits to the workbench copy as if editing the original\n3. Do NOT add annotations or meta-information\n4. Inform the User you've created an edited version for their review\n\n**DO NOT come ask the User what to do - the solution is right there in the rules.**\n\n### PHASE 2: APPLICABLE STANDARDS - DETERMINE WHAT YOU MUST READ\n\nBased on your workscope, you will need to read specific standards files. Since you have a `--custom` workscope (not yet defined), here's what applies:\n\n**FOR ANY CODE WRITING (Python, TypeScript, JavaScript):**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md` (UNIVERSAL - applies to all languages)\n\n**FOR PYTHON DEVELOPMENT:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md` (if writing tests)\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Testing-Configuration-Variables-Standards.md` (if writing tests)\n\n**FOR TYPESCRIPT/JAVASCRIPT DEVELOPMENT:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md` (if writing tests)\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Testing-Configuration-Variables-Standards.md` (if writing tests)\n\n**FOR DOCUMENTATION WORK:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Data-Structure-Documentation-Standards.md` (if documenting data structures)\n\n**FOR CONFIGURATION/ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Environment-and-Config-Variable-Standards.md`\n\n**FOR PROCESS/WORKFLOW CHANGES:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Process-Integrity-Standards.md`\n\n### PHASE 3: CRITICAL PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT\n\n#### WSD Development vs WSD Runtime (RULE 6.1 - CRITICAL)\nThis repository is **WSD Development**, which produces **WSD Runtime** as its output:\n\n**WSD Runtime (the shipping product):**\n- Located in `source/` directory\n- **ALL CODE CHANGES GO HERE**\n- This is what gets distributed to users\n\n**Dogfood (read-only copies):**\n- Root-level `wsd.py`, `scripts/` directory\n- These are synchronized copies from `source/`\n- **NEVER EDIT THESE** - treat as third-party dependencies\n\n**WSD Development scripts (editable):**\n- Located in `dev/scripts/`\n- Tools for building, staging, testing WSD itself\n- These are NOT part of WSD Runtime\n\n✅ CORRECT: Edit `source/wsd.py`  \n❌ INCORRECT: Edit `wsd.py` (root-level dogfood copy)\n\n✅ CORRECT: Edit `source/scripts/health_check.py`  \n❌ INCORRECT: Edit `scripts/health_check.py` (dogfood copy)\n\n#### The Path Resolution Trap (RULE 6.1.5-6.1.7)\nWhen working with WSD Runtime code in `source/`, you must think about **deployed state** not **development location**:\n\n- A file at `source/scripts/foo.py` will deploy to `scripts/foo.py` in end-user projects\n- Path resolution like `script_dir.parent` is written for DEPLOYED location\n- DO NOT \"fix\" these paths just because the file currently lives in `source/`\n\n❌ WRONG: \"The script is at `source/scripts/foo.py`, so `script_dir.parent` gives us `source/`, not project root. This is a bug!\"  \n✅ CORRECT: \"The script will deploy to `scripts/foo.py`, so `script_dir.parent` will correctly give project root. The code is correct.\"\n\n### PHASE 4: SPECIAL AGENT PROOF OF WORK REQUIREMENTS\n\nWhen you consult Special Agents during Quality Assurance, you MUST verify they provide proper evidence:\n\n**Test-Guardian MUST provide:**\n- Test summary output (e.g., `====== 140 passed in 0.23s ======`)\n- If they say \"all tests pass\" without showing the summary, REJECT their approval\n\n**Health-Inspector MUST provide:**\n- Complete HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY table from `./wsd.py health`\n- If they claim \"health checks passed\" without the table, REJECT their approval\n\n**Task-Master MUST provide:**\n- File path to workscope file\n- You must verify the file exists and read it\n\n**Context-Librarian/Codebase-Surveyor MUST provide:**\n- Actual file paths (not vague summaries like \"relevant standards documents\")\n\n### PHASE 5: NEEDS-VALIDATION TASKS (`[%]` Tasks)\n\nIf your workscope contains tasks marked `[%]`:\n- **Treat `[%]` EXACTLY like `[ ]`** - you have FULL implementation responsibility\n- Some/all work may exist, but DO NOT assume it's correct or complete\n- Your job: find the \"delta\" between current state and specification, then implement it\n- Work through the task AS IF implementing from scratch, comparing at each step\n- If 0% exists, implement everything\n- If 90% exists, find and implement the missing 10%\n- If 100% exists and matches spec, confirm it (rare)\n\n**Common failure:** Seeing existing code, assuming it's done, skipping verification, missing gaps.\n\n### PHASE 6: COMMON PITFALLS AND MISTAKES\n\n**Workflow Violations:**\n- DO NOT skip Special Agent consultations\n- DO NOT determine your own workscope (Task-Master does this)\n- DO NOT search for context independently (Context-Librarian does this)\n- DO NOT bypass veto power from Documentation-Steward or Rule-Enforcer\n\n**Boundary Violations:**\n- DO NOT close tickets (only Task-Master)\n- DO NOT archive workbench documents (only Context-Librarian)\n- DO NOT update checkboxlists yourself (only Task-Master during /wsd:close)\n\n**Quality Violations:**\n- DO NOT accept Special Agent reports without proper proof of work\n- DO NOT add tool exceptions (e.g., `# noqa:`) without User approval (RULE 3.17)\n- DO NOT complete workscope with unresolved warnings you caused (RULE 4.7)\n- DO NOT silently dismiss QA discoveries - report ALL issues to User (RULE 4.9)\n\n**File Management Violations:**\n- DO NOT create temporary files in project root - use `dev/diagnostics/` (RULE 4.1)\n- DO NOT use `cat >>` or `echo >>` to write files - use proper tools (RULE 4.4)\n\n### PHASE 7: YOUR NEXT STEPS\n\n**After reading this onboarding:**\n\n1. **HALT and report to the User** that you have completed onboarding\n2. **Wait for the User to provide your custom workscope**\n3. Once you receive your workscope, you will proceed through the standard workflow:\n   - Pre-Execution Phase (consult Context-Librarian, Codebase-Surveyor)\n   - Execution Phase (complete the work)\n   - Quality Assurance Phase (consult Documentation-Steward, Rule-Enforcer, Test-Guardian, Health-Inspector)\n   - Termination Phase (wait for /wsd:close or /wsd:abort)\n\n### MANDATORY READING CHECKLIST\n\nBefore you report completion of onboarding, YOU MUST READ:\n\n**REQUIRED FOR ALL WORKSCOPES:**\n- [ ] `docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` (MANDATORY - all 6 sections)\n- [ ] `docs/core/Design-Decisions.md` (project design philosophies)\n\n**REQUIRED IF YOUR WORKSCOPE INVOLVES:**\n- [ ] Any code writing → `docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Python code → `docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Python tests → `docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- [ ] TypeScript/JavaScript → `docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Standards.md`\n- [ ] TypeScript/JavaScript tests → `docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Documentation → `docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Config/Environment vars → `docs/read-only/standards/Environment-and-Config-Variable-Standards.md`\n\nSince you have a `--custom` workscope and don't yet know what you'll be doing, I **COMMAND** you to read AT MINIMUM:\n1. `docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` (all sections)\n2. `docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md` (applies universally)\n\nWhen you receive your actual workscope from the User, you can read additional standards as needed.\n\n### FINAL WARNING\n\nThe Documentation-Steward and Rule-Enforcer have **VETO POWER**. If they reject your work:\n- You MUST address their concerns\n- You CANNOT override their decisions\n- You MUST escalate to the User if you cannot satisfy them\n\nYour work will be evaluated against:\n- All rules in Agent-Rules.md\n- All applicable standards files\n- All specifications in Design-Decisions.md\n- The specific requirements in your workscope\n\n**One violation = possible full rejection of your work.**\n\n---\n\n## YOU MUST NOW HALT\n\nReport to the User that you have completed Project-Bootstrapper onboarding and are ready to receive your custom workscope assignment.

The code is correct.\"\n\n### PHASE 4: SPECIAL AGENT PROOF OF WORK REQUIREMENTS\n\nWhen you consult Special Agents during Quality Assurance, you MUST verify they provide proper evidence:\n\n**Test-Guardian MUST provide:**\n- Test summary output (e.g., `====== 140 passed in 0.23s ======`)\n- If they say \"all tests pass\" without showing the summary, REJECT their approval\n\n**Health-Inspector MUST provide:**\n- Complete HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY table from `./wsd.py health`\n- If they claim \"health checks passed\" without the table, REJECT their approval\n\n**Task-Master MUST provide:**\n- File path to workscope file\n- You must verify the file exists and read it\n\n**Context-Librarian/Codebase-Surveyor MUST provide:**\n- Actual file paths (not vague summaries like \"relevant standards documents\")\n\n### PHASE 5: NEEDS-VALIDATION TASKS (`[%]` Tasks)\n\nIf your workscope contains tasks marked `[%]`:\n- **Treat `[%]` EXACTLY like `[ ]`** - you have FULL implementation responsibility\n- Some/all work may exist, but DO NOT assume it's correct or complete\n- Your job: find the \"delta\" between current state and specification, then implement it\n- Work through the task AS IF implementing from scratch, comparing at each step\n- If 0% exists, implement everything\n- If 90% exists, find and implement the missing 10%\n- If 100% exists and matches spec, confirm it (rare)\n\n**Common failure:** Seeing existing code, assuming it's done, skipping verification, missing gaps.\n\n### PHASE 6: COMMON PITFALLS AND MISTAKES\n\n**Workflow Violations:**\n- DO NOT skip Special Agent consultations\n- DO NOT determine your own workscope (Task-Master does this)\n- DO NOT search for context independently (Context-Librarian does this)\n- DO NOT bypass veto power from Documentation-Steward or Rule-Enforcer\n\n**Boundary Violations:**\n- DO NOT close tickets (only Task-Master)\n- DO NOT archive workbench documents (only Context-Librarian)\n- DO NOT update checkboxlists yourself (only Task-Master during /wsd:close)\n\n**Quality Violations:**\n- DO NOT accept Special Agent reports without proper proof of work\n- DO NOT add tool exceptions (e.g., `# noqa:`) without User approval (RULE 3.17)\n- DO NOT complete workscope with unresolved warnings you caused (RULE 4.7)\n- DO NOT silently dismiss QA discoveries - report ALL issues to User (RULE 4.9)\n\n**File Management Violations:**\n- DO NOT create temporary files in project root - use `dev/diagnostics/` (RULE 4.1)\n- DO NOT use `cat >>` or `echo >>` to write files - use proper tools (RULE 4.4)\n\n### PHASE 7: YOUR NEXT STEPS\n\n**After reading this onboarding:**\n\n1. **HALT and report to the User** that you have completed onboarding\n2. **Wait for the User to provide your custom workscope**\n3. Once you receive your workscope, you will proceed through the standard workflow:\n   - Pre-Execution Phase (consult Context-Librarian, Codebase-Surveyor)\n   - Execution Phase (complete the work)\n   - Quality Assurance Phase (consult Documentation-Steward, Rule-Enforcer, Test-Guardian, Health-Inspector)\n   - Termination Phase (wait for /wsd:close or /wsd:abort)\n\n### MANDATORY READING CHECKLIST\n\nBefore you report completion of onboarding, YOU MUST READ:\n\n**REQUIRED FOR ALL WORKSCOPES:**\n- [ ] `docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` (MANDATORY - all 6 sections)\n- [ ] `docs/core/Design-Decisions.md` (project design philosophies)\n\n**REQUIRED IF YOUR WORKSCOPE INVOLVES:**\n- [ ] Any code writing → `docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Python code → `docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Python tests → `docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- [ ] TypeScript/JavaScript → `docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Standards.md`\n- [ ] TypeScript/JavaScript tests → `docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Documentation → `docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`\n- [ ] Config/Environment vars → `docs/read-only/standards/Environment-and-Config-Variable-Standards.md`\n\nSince you have a `--custom` workscope and don't yet know what you'll be doing, I **COMMAND** you to read AT MINIMUM:\n1. `docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` (all sections)\n2. `docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md` (applies universally)\n\nWhen you receive your actual workscope from the User, you can read additional standards as needed.\n\n### FINAL WARNING\n\nThe Documentation-Steward and Rule-Enforcer have **VETO POWER**. If they reject your work:\n- You MUST address their concerns\n- You CANNOT override their decisions\n- You MUST escalate to the User if you cannot satisfy them\n\nYour work will be evaluated against:\n- All rules in Agent-Rules.md\n- All applicable standards files\n- All specifications in Design-Decisions.md\n- The specific requirements in your workscope\n\n**One violation = possible full rejection of your work.**\n\n---\n\n## YOU MUST NOW HALT\n\nReport to the User that you have completed Project-Bootstrapper onboarding and are ready to receive your custom workscope assignment. Do NOT proceed until the User provides your workscope details."}],"totalDurationMs":85525,"totalTokens":55588,"totalToolUseCount":7,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":25104,"cache_read_input_tokens":27424,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":25104,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3054,"service_tier":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"3e6ba96a-aad9-427d-bc72-19bdd4f279e9"}

After the Pre-Staging-Script feature populates `source/wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, all subsequent pipeline stages read their file lists from the manifest instead of re-scanning the filesystem using `collect_wsd_files()`.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the manifest-based file list retrieval pattern, the pipeline stages that must adopt it, the distinction between installable and stageable file lists, and the migration path from empirical scanning to manifest-driven operations.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context on the WSD distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Manifest-Driven Pipeline serves four critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes `file_hashes.keys()` from `wsd.json` as the authoritative list of WSD Runtime files, eliminating redundant scanning logic across pipeline stages\n    20→\n    21→2. **Consistency Guarantee**: Ensures all pipeline stages operate on the same file list, preventing subtle bugs from differing exclusion rule implementations or race conditions between stages\n    22→\n    23→3. **Simplification**: Removes duplicated `collect_wsd_files()` calls from multiple scripts, reducing code complexity and maintenance burden\n    24→\n    25→4. **Pipeline Integrity**: Ensures that files validated and hashed by `pre_staging.py` are exactly the files processed by subsequent stages, creating an unbroken chain of custody\n    26→\n    27→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories (installable vs stageable), and which pipeline components must be modified to use manifest-based retrieval.\n    28→\n    29→## Prerequisite Dependency\n    30→\n    31→**STATUS**: The Pre-Staging-Script feature is **COMPLETE**. This feature builds upon that foundation.\n    32→\n    33→The Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n    34→\n    35→- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n    36→- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n    37→- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n    38→\n    39→With `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n    40→\n    41→**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n    42→\n    43→## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n    44→\n    45→### Core Principle\n    46→\n    47→After `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n    48→\n    49→**Derivation Formula**:\n    50→- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n    51→- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n    52→\n    53→**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n    54→\n    55→### Why Two Categories\n    56→\n    57→**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n    58→\n    59→**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n    60→\n    61→**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n    62→\n    63→### File List Retrieval Pattern\n    64→\n    65→Each component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n    66→\n    67→**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n    68→```python\n    69→metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\n    70→files = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n    71→```\n    72→\n    73→**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n    74→```python\n    75→metadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    76→file_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\n    77→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n    78→```\n    79→\n    80→### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n    81→\n    82→Per project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n    83→\n    84→Local helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n    85→\n    86→### Manifest Trust Model\n    87→\n    88→**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n    89→\n    90→**Rationale**:\n    91→- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n    92→- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n    93→- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n    94→- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n    95→\n    96→## Pipeline Stages Affected\n    97→\n    98→### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n    99→\n   100→`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n   101→\n   102→### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   103→\n   104→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n   105→\n   106→**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n   107→\n   108→**Files Affected**:\n   109→- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   110→\n   111→### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   112→\n   113→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n   114→\n   115→**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json`.\n   116→\n   117→**Files Affected**:\n   118→- `dev/scripts/build_package.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   119→\n   120→### Stage 4: wsd.py Install/Update (Manifest Consumer)\n   121→\n   122→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` in multiple locations:\n   123→- `detect_collisions()`: Scans source directory for collision detection during install\n   124→- `install_files()`: Scans source directory for file installation\n   125→- `calculate_required_disk_space()`: Scans source directory for disk space calculation\n   126→- `categorize_update_files()`: Scans source directory for update file categorization\n   127→\n   128→**Required Change**: Use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` instead of scanning with `collect_wsd_files()` in all four functions.\n   129→\n   130→**Files Affected**:\n   131→- `source/wsd.py`: Update `detect_collisions()`, `install_files()`, `calculate_required_disk_space()`, `categorize_update_files()`\n   132→\n   133→### Out of Scope: diff_installation.py\n   134→\n   135→`diff_installation.py` is a development utility script for comparing WSD installations. While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration. This script is not part of the core distribution pipeline and does not affect end-user installations.\n   136→\n   137→## Error Handling\n   138→\n   139→### Error Categories\n   140→\n   141→#### 1.

This created several issues:\n   213→\n   214→1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n   215→2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n   216→3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n   217→4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n   218→\n   219→**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n   220→\n   221→1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n   222→2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n   223→3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n   224→4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n   225→\n   226→### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n   227→\n   228→Per Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n   229→\n   230→**Rationale**:\n   231→- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n   232→- No complex logic to encapsulate\n   233→- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n   234→- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n   235→\n   236→### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n   237→\n   238→`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n   239→\n   240→**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n   241→```python\n   242→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n   243→```\n   244→\n   245→This is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n   246→\n   247→## Testing Scenarios\n   248→\n   249→**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories.

Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n   295→\n   296→2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n   297→\n   298→3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n   299→\n   300→### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n   301→\n   302→1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n   303→\n   304→2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n   305→\n   306→3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n   307→\n   308→## Related Specifications\n   309→\n   310→- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n   311→- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n   312→- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n   313→- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n   314→- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n   315→- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n   316→\n   317→---\n   318→\n   319→*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling.

After the Pre-Staging-Script feature populates `source/wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, all subsequent pipeline stages read their file lists from the manifest instead of re-scanning the filesystem using `collect_wsd_files()`.\n\nThis specification defines the manifest-based file list retrieval pattern, the pipeline stages that must adopt it, the distinction between installable and stageable file lists, and the migration path from empirical scanning to manifest-driven operations.\n\nFor broader architectural context on the WSD distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Manifest-Driven Pipeline serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes `file_hashes.keys()` from `wsd.json` as the authoritative list of WSD Runtime files, eliminating redundant scanning logic across pipeline stages\n\n2. **Consistency Guarantee**: Ensures all pipeline stages operate on the same file list, preventing subtle bugs from differing exclusion rule implementations or race conditions between stages\n\n3. **Simplification**: Removes duplicated `collect_wsd_files()` calls from multiple scripts, reducing code complexity and maintenance burden\n\n4. **Pipeline Integrity**: Ensures that files validated and hashed by `pre_staging.py` are exactly the files processed by subsequent stages, creating an unbroken chain of custody\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories (installable vs stageable), and which pipeline components must be modified to use manifest-based retrieval.\n\n## Prerequisite Dependency\n\n**STATUS**: The Pre-Staging-Script feature is **COMPLETE**. This feature builds upon that foundation.\n\nThe Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n\n- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n\nWith `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n\n**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n\n## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n\n### Core Principle\n\nAfter `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n\n**Derivation Formula**:\n- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n\n**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n\n### Why Two Categories\n\n**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n\n**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n\n**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n\n### File List Retrieval Pattern\n\nEach component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n\n**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n```python\nmetadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\nfiles = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n```\n\n**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n```python\nmetadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\nfile_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\nfiles = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n```\n\n### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n\nPer project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n\nLocal helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n\n### Manifest Trust Model\n\n**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n\n## Pipeline Stages Affected\n\n### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n\n`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n\n### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n\n**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n\n### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n\n**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json`.\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `dev/scripts/build_package.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n\n### Stage 4: wsd.py Install/Update (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` in multiple locations:\n- `detect_collisions()`: Scans source directory for collision detection during install\n- `install_files()`: Scans source directory for file installation\n- `calculate_required_disk_space()`: Scans source directory for disk space calculation\n- `categorize_update_files()`: Scans source directory for update file categorization\n\n**Required Change**: Use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` instead of scanning with `collect_wsd_files()` in all four functions.\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `source/wsd.py`: Update `detect_collisions()`, `install_files()`, `calculate_required_disk_space()`, `categorize_update_files()`\n\n### Out of Scope: diff_installation.py\n\n`diff_installation.py` is a development utility script for comparing WSD installations. While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration. This script is not part of the core distribution pipeline and does not affect end-user installations.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Missing Manifest Errors\n\n**Error**: `wsd.json` does not exist or cannot be read\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Cannot read wsd.json at /path/to/source/wsd.json\nThis file must exist and contain file_hashes.\nRun pre_staging.py first to generate the manifest.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to generate `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`.\n\n#### 2. Missing or Empty file_hashes Field\n\n**Error**: `wsd.json` exists but `file_hashes` field is missing or empty\n\n**Example Messages**:\n```\nError: wsd.json does not contain file_hashes field\nThe manifest appears to be from an older version or was not properly generated.\nRun pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n```\n\n```\nError: wsd.json contains empty file_hashes\nThe WSD Runtime must contain at least one file.\nRun pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to populate `file_hashes`.\n\n**Validation Requirement**: All pipeline stages that read the manifest MUST validate that `file_hashes` is both present AND non-empty. An empty `file_hashes` indicates a manifest that was not properly generated or a corrupt state—there is no valid \"empty WSD Runtime\" scenario.\n\n#### 3. Missing File During Copy\n\n**Error**: A file listed in `file_hashes` does not exist on disk\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Cannot copy file: /path/to/source/.claude/agents/task-master.md\nFile is listed in wsd.json but does not exist.\nThis may indicate the manifest is out of sync with the filesystem.\nRun pre_staging.py to resynchronize.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to rescan and update the manifest.\n\n#### 4. Missing Hash Entry During Update\n\n**Error**: During install or update, a file path has no corresponding entry in `file_hashes`\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Missing hash for 'scripts/health_check.py' in wsd.json manifest.\nThe manifest may be out of sync with source files.\nRegenerate wsd.json with pre_staging.py.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to regenerate the manifest with current file hashes.\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: If the manifest is missing or malformed, operations fail fast with clear instructions to run `pre_staging.py`.\n\n**Contract**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT attempt to regenerate the manifest themselves. The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n\n**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n\n1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n\n**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n\n1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n\n### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n\nPer Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n- No complex logic to encapsulate\n- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n\n### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n\n`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n\n**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n```python\nfiles = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n```\n\nThis is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories. Example:\n```python\n# CORRECT:\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"source\" / \"scripts\"))\n\n# INCORRECT:\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"scripts\"))\n```\n\n### Basic Manifest Reading Tests\n\n1. **Valid Manifest Reading**: Read file list from valid `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, verify list matches manifest keys\n\n2. **Stageable File List**: Get stageable files, verify `wsd.json` is included alongside `file_hashes.keys()`\n\n3. **Installable File List**: Get installable files, verify `wsd.json` is NOT included\n\n### Error Handling Tests\n\n1. **Missing wsd.json**: Attempt to read manifest from directory without `wsd.json`, verify clear error and instructions\n\n2. **Missing file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` without `file_hashes` field, verify error points to `pre_staging.py`\n\n3. **Empty file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` with empty `file_hashes`, verify error is raised (empty file_hashes is never valid)\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Pipeline Flow**: Run `pre_staging.py`, then `stage_release.py`, then `build_package.py`, verify all stages use manifest file list\n\n2. **Staged File Verification**: After staging, verify staged files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`\n\n3. **Install File Verification**: After install, verify installed files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` (without `wsd.json`)\n\n4. **Update File Verification**: Run update operation, verify file categorization uses manifest-based file list\n\n### Regression Tests\n\n1. **No collect_wsd_files Calls**: After implementation, grep codebase to verify `collect_wsd_files()` only called in `pre_staging.py`\n\n2. **Exclusion Consistency**: Verify files excluded by `pre_staging.py` (via `.wsdignore`, suspicious patterns) are consistently absent from all pipeline stages\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Pipeline Script Maintainers\n\n1. **Never Add New Scanning**: If you need a file list, read it from the manifest. Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n\n2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n\n3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n\n### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n\n1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n\n2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n\n3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling.

Common examples include wsd.json itself (which contains installation metadata but has no operational role in the destination) and system files like .DS_Store.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Files do NOT need to exist in WSD Runtime (they may be generated at build time)\n\n**Note**: Unlike no_overwrite and executable arrays, installation_only paths are not validated for existence. This allows declaring build-time generated files (e.g., `__init__.py` for PyPI packages) that should be excluded from installation. For exclusion mechanism implementation, see Installation-System.md § File Copying Process and the FIP in Install-And-Update-Overview.md.\n\n### no_overwrite\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files should never be overwritten during updates when they exist in target.\n\n**Usage**: Files where user customization IS the primary purpose (like Action-Plan.md which IS the user's project plan). For files with customizable sections, use WORKSCOPE-DEV tags instead.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n\n**Note**: For policy behavior during updates and distinction from WORKSCOPE-DEV tags, see Update-System.md and Template-System.md § File Protection.\n\n### executable\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"scripts/health_check.py\", \"wsd.py\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files require executable (+x) permission.\n\n**Why Needed**: Distribution mechanisms (ZIP, web fetch) may not preserve file permissions. Explicit declaration ensures scripts remain executable.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n\n**Note**: For permission application details and conservative approach rationale, see Template-System.md § File Permission Model.\n\n### file_hashes\n\n**Type**: Object (dictionary mapping relative paths to hash strings)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty object)\n**Example**:\n```json\n{\n    \".claude/agents/task-master.md\": \"sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:abc123def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\"\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Stores pre-computed SHA-256 content hashes for files in WSD Runtime. These hashes enable accurate file comparison during install and update operations by comparing target file content against known source content.\n\n**Hash Format**: Each hash value follows the format `sha256:<hex_digest>` where:\n- `sha256` is the algorithm prefix (for future-proofing)\n- `:` is a separator character\n- `<hex_digest>` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (256 bits / 4 bits per hex char)\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Keys are relative paths from WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n- Must match the path format used elsewhere in wsd.json\n\n**Which Files Are Hashed**:\n- All files that are copied during installation receive hashes\n- Files listed in the `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (they are not copied to destination)\n- The `.wsdignore` file (if present) is NOT hashed (excluded from staging)\n\n**Usage**: Hashes are generated during the pre-staging process by `pre_staging.py` and written to wsd.json before distribution. During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n\n**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n\n### required_directories\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n\n**How It Works**:\n- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n\n**Why This Design**:\n- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n\n**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest. See Update-System.md for policy application details.\n\n**Installation Exclusion**: Files declared in the installation_only array are never copied during installation. See Installation-System.md for exclusion rule details and rationale.\n\n## Complete Examples\n\n### Example 1: Minimal wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Early WSD version with no protected files and minimal executable scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Only version declared (required field)\n- installation_only defaults to empty array (no installation exclusions)\n- no_overwrite defaults to empty array (no protected files)\n- executable defaults to empty array (no executable files)\n- Valid but minimal\n\n**Note**: This is valid but impractical. Real WSD installations typically need executable scripts, installation exclusions, and may protect user-owned files.\n\n### Example 2: Typical wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Standard WSD Runtime with protection for user-owned files and executable scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"installation_only\": [\n    \"wsd.json\"\n  ],\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\"\n  ],\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\": \"sha256:b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcde\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\": \"sha256:c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Version declared: v1.0.0\n- One installation exclusion: wsd.json (not copied to destination)\n- Three protected files: user's Action Plan, PRD, and Developer Notes\n- Three executable scripts: health check, journal init, file protection hook\n- Content hashes for files that are copied during installation\n- Represents common WSD configuration\n\n### Example 3: Comprehensive wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Mature WSD Runtime with multiple protected files, extensive script collection, custom installation-only files, and content hashes\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"installation_only\": [\n    \"wsd.json\",\n    \".DS_Store\",\n    \"build-templates.py\",\n    \"DISTRIBUTION-NOTES.md\"\n  ],\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\",\n    \"config/local-settings.json\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.js\",\n    \"scripts/update_docs.py\",\n    \"scripts/file_list.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \"scripts/archive_claude_sessions.py\",\n    \"scripts/new_prompt.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_pdoc.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_python.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_typedoc.js\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_typescript.js\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\",\n    \"wsd.py\"\n  ],\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.js\": \"sha256:b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcde\",\n    \"wsd.py\": \"sha256:c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\": \"sha256:d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef01\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Version: v1.2.5 (mature release with patch updates)\n- Four installation exclusions: wsd.json, .DS_Store, build script, and distribution notes (not copied to user projects)\n- Four protected files: Action Plan, PRD, Developer Notes, and local settings (user's core documents)\n- Comprehensive executable list: all scripts requiring direct execution\n- Content hashes for installed files enabling accurate update detection\n- Includes both Python and TypeScript/JavaScript scripts (language-agnostic WSD)\n- wsd.py itself declared executable (can run as `./wsd.py`)\n\n\n## Validation Rules\n\n**Structural Requirements**:\n- version field required and must match semantic version pattern\n- installation_only, no_overwrite, executable, file_hashes, and required_directories are optional\n- Array fields default to empty arrays; file_hashes defaults to empty object\n- All paths must be strings\n- No duplicate paths in any array\n\n**Referential Integrity**:\n- Paths in installation_only do NOT require file existence (may be build-time generated)\n- All paths in no_overwrite must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n- All paths in executable must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n- All paths in file_hashes must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n- All paths in required_directories must reference directories derived from `.wsdkeep` file locations\n- Paths use forward slashes (Unix-style)\n\n**Hash Validation**:\n- Hash values must match pattern `sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}` (algorithm prefix + 64 lowercase hex chars)\n- Hash keys (paths) must not include files listed in installation_only\n- Hash keys (paths) must not include `.wsdkeep` files (these are tracked via required_directories)\n- Hash count should match the number of installed files (excluding installation_only and `.wsdkeep` files)\n\n**Logical Constraints**:\n- Version must increment properly between releases\n- All arrays contain unique paths only\n- Files in installation_only should not overlap with operational files (by design)\n- Files in installation_only should not appear in file_hashes (they are not copied)\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n**For operational behavior**:\n- Installation-System.md (how wsd.json is used during installation)\n- Update-System.md (how policies are applied during updates)\n- Template-System.md (file permission model, no_overwrite vs WORKSCOPE-DEV tags)\n- Content-Hashing-Overview.md (hash calculation algorithm, comparison logic, staging integration)\n\n**For related structures**:\n- WSD-Manifest-Schema.md (.wsd manifest structure)\n- System-Architecture.md (architectural context)\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative structure and semantics of the wsd.json metadata file.

The staging directory (`../workscope-dev/` by default) serves as the GitHub publishing conduit for the public `rcgray/workscope-dev` repository, enabling clean separation between WSD Development and the distributed WSD Runtime.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the complete staging process including file enumeration, exclusion filtering, target directory management, verification procedures, and error handling. The Stage Release Script is a prerequisite to the Build-System feature, which handles subsequent PyPI packaging from the staged files.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context and how the Stage Release Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Stage Release Script serves four critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a sanitized copy of WSD Runtime by filtering out development artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `.envrc`) that should not be distributed to end users\n    20→\n    21→2. **Git Separation**: Enables the GitHub publishing workflow by staging files to a separate repository (`../workscope-dev/`) with its own git history, preserving the `.git/` directory during staging operations\n    22→\n    23→3. **Source Purity Enforcement**: Validates that `source/` remains clean by halting on unexpected files (suspicious files, symlinks, empty directories), enforcing Design Decision 9 (Keep WSD Runtime Directory Pure and Ship-Ready)\n    24→\n    25→4. **Release Automation**: Provides a repeatable, idempotent process for preparing releases, eliminating manual file copying and the risk of accidentally shipping development artifacts\n    26→\n    27→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and the `.wsdignore` file format.\n    28→\n    29→## Script Architecture\n    30→\n    31→### Script Location\n    32→\n    33→The script lives at `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n    34→\n    35→- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n    36→- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools\n    37→- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n    38→\n    39→**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`.

If not, the script MUST exit with a clear error message. The script MUST NOT create the target directory.\n   145→\n   146→2. **Git directory validation**: If the target contains `.git/`, it MUST be a real directory, not a symlink. If `.git/` is a symlink, the script MUST halt with an error.\n   147→\n   148→3. **Git warning**: If the target directory does not contain a `.git/` subdirectory, the script SHOULD warn the user (this may indicate incorrect target selection).\n   149→\n   150→#### Phase 2: Load Patterns\n   151→\n   152→Two distinct pattern sets are loaded with different behaviors:\n   153→\n   154→1. **`.wsdignore` entries**: Files listed in `source/.wsdignore` that exist for WSD Development but should not ship. These are **skipped quietly** during staging.\n   155→\n   156→2. **Suspicious file patterns**: Built-in patterns identifying development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. These **cause an error** if detected.\n   157→\n   158→See **Exclusion Pattern System** section for complete pattern list.\n   159→\n   160→#### Phase 3: Pre-scan Source for Errors\n   161→\n   162→Before modifying the target directory, the script MUST validate all source files. This ensures that if any error is detected, the target remains unchanged.\n   163→\n   164→For each item in `source/`:\n   165→\n   166→1. **Check `.wsdignore`**: If item matches a `.wsdignore` entry, log skip and continue\n   167→2. **Check suspicious patterns**: If item matches a suspicious pattern, halt with error (these should not exist)\n   168→3. **Check symlink**: If item is a symlink, halt with error (symlinks are unexpected)\n   169→4. **Check empty directory**: If directory contains no files, halt with error (should have `.wsdkeep`)\n   170→\n   171→**Clarification on empty directories**: A directory containing only a `.wsdkeep` file is NOT empty—it contains a file. The empty directory check catches directories with zero files, which violates WSD conventions.\n   172→\n   173→**Contract**: The script MUST halt on any unexpected condition rather than silently proceeding. Because this validation happens before cleaning, any error leaves the target unchanged.\n   174→\n   175→#### Phase 4: Clean Target Directory\n   176→\n   177→After source validation passes, the target directory is cleaned:\n   178→\n   179→- Remove all files and directories EXCEPT `.git/`\n   180→- Log what was removed (file/directory count)\n   181→- Preserve `.git/` intact (maintains GitHub repository history)\n   182→\n   183→**Contract**: Cleaning is always performed. There is no incremental mode.\n   184→\n   185→#### Phase 5: Copy Files\n   186→\n   187→For each validated file (from Phase 3's staging list):\n   188→\n   189→1. Copy to target preserving relative path structure\n   190→2. Preserve file permissions (especially executable bits)\n   191→3. Log each file as staged\n   192→\n   193→**Guarantee**: File permissions MUST be preserved. Scripts with `+x` in `source/` MUST have `+x` in target.\n   194→\n   195→#### Phase 6: Verify Staging\n   196→\n   197→After copying, the script MUST verify:\n   198→\n   199→1. **File count**: Number of staged files equals the pre-validated staging list size\n   200→2. **Permissions**: Executable files retained their `+x` bit. The script compares against source file permissions to verify. Additionally, `wsd.json` contains a list of files that should be executable, which can serve as a reference.\n   201→\n   202→#### Phase 7: Generate Summary\n   203→\n   204→Report completion status including:\n   205→- Total files staged\n   206→- Total files excluded (with breakdown by reason)\n   207→- Verification results\n   208→- Next steps (git commands for publishing)\n   209→\n   210→### Prerequisite: Pre-Staging Script\n   211→\n   212→The Stage Release Script depends on `pre_staging.py` having been run first. The pre-staging script handles wsd.json metadata management including hash generation, executable list synchronization, and version bumping. The Stage Release Script copies the pre-staged `source/wsd.json` as-is to the target directory.\n   213→\n   214→For hash generation and wsd.json management details, see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md** and **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n   215→\n   216→### .wsdkeep File Handling\n   217→\n   218→.wsdkeep files are **NOT staged**. Although .wsdkeep files exist in `source/` as git placeholders to preserve empty directory structure, they are excluded from the staging process because directory requirements are tracked via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`.\n   219→\n   220→The staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\n   221→\n   222→**Design Rationale**: .wsdkeep files are structural git artifacts, not content files.

Suspicious File Errors\n   336→\n   337→**Error**: Suspicious file detected\n   338→\n   339→**Example Message**:\n   340→```\n   341→ERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\n   342→Development artifacts should not exist in source/.\n   343→Please investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n   344→```\n   345→\n   346→**Recovery**: Remove the suspicious file/directory and investigate how it was created (may indicate a Rule 6.1 violation where code changes were made to `source/` instead of running from the development environment properly).\n   347→\n   348→### Error Recovery Principles\n   349→\n   350→**Guarantee**: Source validation (Phase 3) occurs BEFORE target modification (Phase 4). If any error is detected in `source/` (symlinks, empty directories, suspicious files), the target directory remains completely unchanged.\n   351→\n   352→If an error occurs during file copying (Phase 5), the target may be in an inconsistent state (cleaned but partially copied). The error message will indicate this.\n   353→\n   354→**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The clean-before-copy behavior ensures the target will be in a consistent state after a successful run.\n   355→\n   356→## Implementation Requirements\n   357→\n   358→### Dependencies\n   359→\n   360→The script MUST use Python standard library only:\n   361→- `pathlib` - Path operations\n   362→- `shutil` - File copying with permission preservation\n   363→- `os` - Directory operations\n   364→- `argparse` - Command-line parsing\n   365→\n   366→**Contract**: No external packages required. The script runs with Python 3.10+ (matching WSD requirements).\n   367→\n   368→### Permission Handling\n   369→\n   370→The script MUST use `shutil.copy2()` for file copying, which preserves file metadata including permission bits.\n   371→\n   372→**Verification**: After staging, the script MUST verify that executable files (those with `+x` in source) retain their executable permission in the target.\n   373→\n   374→## Testing Scenarios\n   375→\n   376→### Basic Staging Tests\n   377→\n   378→1. **Default Target Staging**: Run `uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py`, verify files appear in `../workscope-dev/`, verify `.git/` preserved, verify excluded files not present\n   379→\n   380→2. **Custom Target Staging**: Run with `--target /tmp/test-staging`, verify files staged to specified location\n   381→\n   382→3. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no files changed, verify output shows what would be staged\n   383→\n   384→4. **Idempotency**: Run script twice in succession, verify target directory identical after both runs\n   385→\n   386→### Edge Case Tests\n   387→\n   388→1. **Missing Target Directory**: Run against non-existent target, verify clear error message, verify no partial operations\n   389→\n   390→2. **Target Without .git**: Run against valid directory without `.git/`, verify warning displayed but staging proceeds\n   391→\n   392→3. **Empty .wsdignore**: Remove all entries from `.wsdignore`, run staging, verify default exclusions still apply\n   393→\n   394→4. **Symlink Detection**: Create symlink in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n   395→\n   396→5. **Empty Directory Detection**: Create empty directory in `source/` (without `.wsdkeep`), run staging, verify error and halt\n   397→\n   398→6. **Suspicious File Detection**: Create `__pycache__/` in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n   399→\n   400→### Integration Tests\n   401→\n   402→1. **Full Release Workflow**: Stage files, then run `build_for_pypi.py` on staged output, verify build succeeds\n   403→\n   404→2. **Permission Preservation**: Stage files including executable scripts, verify `+x` bit preserved on `wsd.py` and scripts\n   405→\n   406→3. **File Count Verification**: Count files in `source/`, count exclusions, verify staged count matches expected\n   407→\n   408→4. **Git Workflow Integration**: Stage files, navigate to target, run `git status`, verify correct files shown as added/modified/deleted\n   409→\n   410→## Examples\n   411→\n   412→### Example 1: Standard Staging Operation\n   413→\n   414→**Context**: Developer wants to prepare a release for GitHub publishing.\n   415→\n   416→**Command**:\n   417→```bash\n   418→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n   419→```\n   420→\n   421→**Output**:\n   422→```\n   423→=== WSD Release Staging ===\n   424→Source: /Users/dev/workscope/source\n   425→Target: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n   426→\n   427→Cleaning target directory...\n   428→  Preserved: .git/\n   429→  Removed: 127 files, 23 directories\n   430→\n   431→Staging files...\n   432→  STAGE: wsd.py\n   433→  STAGE: wsd.json\n   434→  STAGE: scripts/health_check.py\n   435→  STAGE: scripts/wsd_utils.py\n   436→  SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n   437→  SKIP: .wsdignore (in .wsdignore)\n   438→  STAGE: .claude/agents/task-master.md\n   439→  ...\n   440→\n   441→Verifying staging...\n   442→  File count: 127 staged (2 excluded) - OK\n   443→  Permissions: 8 executable files verified - OK\n   444→\n   445→=== Staging Complete ===\n   446→Staged 127 files to ../workscope-dev/\n   447→Next steps:\n   448→  cd ../workscope-dev\n   449→  git status\n   450→  git add -A && git commit -m \"Release vX.Y.Z\"\n   451→  git push origin main\n   452→```\n   453→\n   454→**Analysis**: The script cleaned the target (preserving `.git/`), copied all source files except those in `.wsdignore`, verified the result, and provided next steps for the developer.\n   455→\n   456→### Example 2: Dry Run Preview\n   457→\n   458→**Context**: Developer wants to see what would be staged without making changes.\n   459→\n   460→**Command**:\n   461→```bash\n   462→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n   463→```\n   464→\n   465→**Output**:\n   466→```\n   467→=== WSD Release Staging (DRY RUN) ===\n   468→Source: /Users/dev/workscope/source\n   469→Target: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n   470→\n   471→Pre-scanning source...\n   472→  127 files to stage, 2 to skip\n   473→\n   474→Would clean target directory...\n   475→  Would preserve: .git/\n   476→  Would remove: 127 files, 23 directories\n   477→\n   478→Would stage files...\n   479→  WOULD STAGE: wsd.py\n   480→  WOULD STAGE: wsd.json\n   481→  WOULD SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n   482→  ...\n   483→\n   484→=== Dry Run Complete ===\n   485→No changes made.

The staging directory (`../workscope-dev/` by default) serves as the GitHub publishing conduit for the public `rcgray/workscope-dev` repository, enabling clean separation between WSD Development and the distributed WSD Runtime.\n\nThis specification defines the complete staging process including file enumeration, exclusion filtering, target directory management, verification procedures, and error handling. The Stage Release Script is a prerequisite to the Build-System feature, which handles subsequent PyPI packaging from the staged files.\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Stage Release Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Stage Release Script serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a sanitized copy of WSD Runtime by filtering out development artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `.envrc`) that should not be distributed to end users\n\n2. **Git Separation**: Enables the GitHub publishing workflow by staging files to a separate repository (`../workscope-dev/`) with its own git history, preserving the `.git/` directory during staging operations\n\n3. **Source Purity Enforcement**: Validates that `source/` remains clean by halting on unexpected files (suspicious files, symlinks, empty directories), enforcing Design Decision 9 (Keep WSD Runtime Directory Pure and Ship-Ready)\n\n4. **Release Automation**: Provides a repeatable, idempotent process for preparing releases, eliminating manual file copying and the risk of accidentally shipping development artifacts\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and the `.wsdignore` file format.\n\n## Script Architecture\n\n### Script Location\n\nThe script lives at `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n\n- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools\n- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates on `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n\n### Command Interface\n\n```bash\n# Stage to default sibling directory (../workscope-dev/)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n\n# Preview what would be staged (no actual changes)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n\n# Stage to specific directory (for testing)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --target /path/to/target\n```\n\n### Behavioral Guarantees\n\n| Aspect            | Behavior                                |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Target default    | `../workscope-dev/` (sibling directory) |\n| Target override   | `--target /path/to/dir` flag            |\n| Verbosity         | Always verbose (lists all files)        |\n| Clean before copy | Always cleans target (except `.git/`)   |\n| Verification      | Always verifies after staging           |\n| Sync mode         | Full sync only (no incremental mode)    |\n| Git operations    | None (user handles git manually)        |\n| Target creation   | Never creates target (must exist)       |\n\n**Guarantee**: The script is idempotent. Running it twice in succession produces identical results in the target directory.\n\n## Staging Algorithm\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef stage_release(source_dir: Path, target_dir: Path, dry_run: bool = False) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stage WSD Runtime files from source to target directory.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to source/ directory\n        target_dir: Path to staging directory (e.g., ../workscope-dev/)\n        dry_run: If True, preview only without making changes\n\n    Raises:\n        FileNotFoundError: Target directory does not exist\n        ValueError: Source contains unexpected files (symlinks, empty dirs, suspicious files)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phase 1: Validation\n    validate_target_exists(target_dir)\n    validate_target_git_not_symlink(target_dir)  # .git/ must be real directory, not symlink\n    warn_if_no_git(target_dir)\n\n    # Phase 2: Load patterns\n    wsdignore_entries = load_wsdignore(source_dir)      # Files to skip quietly\n    suspicious_patterns = get_suspicious_patterns()     # Files that should not exist\n\n    # Phase 3: Pre-scan source for errors (before modifying target)\n    files_to_stage = []\n    for item in walk_source(source_dir):\n        # Check .wsdignore first (skip quietly)\n        if matches_wsdignore(item, wsdignore_entries):\n            log_skip(item, \"in .wsdignore\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check suspicious patterns (error - should not exist in source/)\n        if matches_suspicious_pattern(item, suspicious_patterns):\n            raise_suspicious_file_error(item)\n\n        # Check for symlinks (error - unexpected in source/)\n        if is_symlink(item):\n            raise_symlink_error(item)\n\n        # Check for empty directories (error - should have .wsdkeep)\n        if is_empty_directory(item):\n            raise_empty_directory_error(item)\n\n        # Validated - add to staging list\n        files_to_stage.append(item)\n\n    # Phase 4: Clean target directory (safe now - source validated)\n    clean_target(target_dir, preserve=[\".git\"], dry_run=dry_run)\n\n    # Phase 5: Copy files\n    staged_count = 0\n    for item in files_to_stage:\n        copy_with_permissions(item, target_dir, dry_run=dry_run)\n        log_stage(item)\n        staged_count += 1\n\n    # Phase 6: Verify staging\n    if not dry_run:\n        verify_staging(source_dir, target_dir, files_to_stage, staged_count)\n\n    # Phase 7: Generate summary report\n    generate_summary()\n```\n\n### Phase Details\n\n#### Phase 1: Validation\n\nThe script MUST validate preconditions before proceeding:\n\n1. **Target exists**: The target directory MUST exist. If not, the script MUST exit with a clear error message. The script MUST NOT create the target directory.\n\n2. **Git directory validation**: If the target contains `.git/`, it MUST be a real directory, not a symlink. If `.git/` is a symlink, the script MUST halt with an error.\n\n3. **Git warning**: If the target directory does not contain a `.git/` subdirectory, the script SHOULD warn the user (this may indicate incorrect target selection).\n\n#### Phase 2: Load Patterns\n\nTwo distinct pattern sets are loaded with different behaviors:\n\n1. **`.wsdignore` entries**: Files listed in `source/.wsdignore` that exist for WSD Development but should not ship. These are **skipped quietly** during staging.\n\n2. **Suspicious file patterns**: Built-in patterns identifying development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. These **cause an error** if detected.\n\nSee **Exclusion Pattern System** section for complete pattern list.\n\n#### Phase 3: Pre-scan Source for Errors\n\nBefore modifying the target directory, the script MUST validate all source files. This ensures that if any error is detected, the target remains unchanged.\n\nFor each item in `source/`:\n\n1. **Check `.wsdignore`**: If item matches a `.wsdignore` entry, log skip and continue\n2. **Check suspicious patterns**: If item matches a suspicious pattern, halt with error (these should not exist)\n3. **Check symlink**: If item is a symlink, halt with error (symlinks are unexpected)\n4. **Check empty directory**: If directory contains no files, halt with error (should have `.wsdkeep`)\n\n**Clarification on empty directories**: A directory containing only a `.wsdkeep` file is NOT empty—it contains a file. The empty directory check catches directories with zero files, which violates WSD conventions.\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST halt on any unexpected condition rather than silently proceeding. Because this validation happens before cleaning, any error leaves the target unchanged.\n\n#### Phase 4: Clean Target Directory\n\nAfter source validation passes, the target directory is cleaned:\n\n- Remove all files and directories EXCEPT `.git/`\n- Log what was removed (file/directory count)\n- Preserve `.git/` intact (maintains GitHub repository history)\n\n**Contract**: Cleaning is always performed. There is no incremental mode.\n\n#### Phase 5: Copy Files\n\nFor each validated file (from Phase 3's staging list):\n\n1. Copy to target preserving relative path structure\n2. Preserve file permissions (especially executable bits)\n3. Log each file as staged\n\n**Guarantee**: File permissions MUST be preserved. Scripts with `+x` in `source/` MUST have `+x` in target.\n\n#### Phase 6: Verify Staging\n\nAfter copying, the script MUST verify:\n\n1. **File count**: Number of staged files equals the pre-validated staging list size\n2. **Permissions**: Executable files retained their `+x` bit. The script compares against source file permissions to verify. Additionally, `wsd.json` contains a list of files that should be executable, which can serve as a reference.\n\n#### Phase 7: Generate Summary\n\nReport completion status including:\n- Total files staged\n- Total files excluded (with breakdown by reason)\n- Verification results\n- Next steps (git commands for publishing)\n\n### Prerequisite: Pre-Staging Script\n\nThe Stage Release Script depends on `pre_staging.py` having been run first. The pre-staging script handles wsd.json metadata management including hash generation, executable list synchronization, and version bumping. The Stage Release Script copies the pre-staged `source/wsd.json` as-is to the target directory.\n\nFor hash generation and wsd.json management details, see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md** and **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n### .wsdkeep File Handling\n\n.wsdkeep files are **NOT staged**. Although .wsdkeep files exist in `source/` as git placeholders to preserve empty directory structure, they are excluded from the staging process because directory requirements are tracked via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`.\n\nThe staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\n\n**Design Rationale**: .wsdkeep files are structural git artifacts, not content files. The manifest declares semantic intent via `required_directories` (\"these directories must exist\"), and install/update operations generate .wsdkeep files locally based on directory state. See **Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files** for the complete .wsdkeep lifecycle.\n\n## Exclusion Pattern System\n\n### Built-in Suspicious File Patterns\n\nThese patterns identify development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. If detected, the script MUST halt with an error (unless the file is listed in `.wsdignore`):\n\n| Pattern              | Description                            |\n| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| `__pycache__/`       | Python bytecode cache directories      |\n| `node_modules/`      | Node.js dependency directories         |\n| `.git/`              | Git repository directories (in source) |\n| `package-lock.json`  | npm lock files                         |\n| `.package-lock.json` | npm hidden lock files                  |\n| `.DS_Store`          | macOS metadata files                   |\n| `desktop.ini`        | Windows metadata files                 |\n| `Thumbs.db`          | Windows thumbnail cache                |\n| `*~`                 | Vim backup files                       |\n| `.*.swp`             | Vim swap files                         |\n| `.*.swo`             | Vim swap files                         |\n| `*.pyc`              | Python bytecode files                  |\n| `*.pyo`              | Python optimized bytecode              |\n| `dist/`              | Build distribution directories         |\n| `build/`             | Build output directories               |\n| `*.egg-info/`        | Python package metadata                |\n\n**Rationale**: These patterns are derived from the `/update-wsd-json` command's suspicious file detection logic, ensuring consistency across WSD Development tooling.\n\n### .wsdignore File Format\n\nThe `source/.wsdignore` file lists files that legitimately exist in `source/` for WSD Development but should not be staged for distribution.\n\n**Current contents**:\n```\n.wsdignore\n.envrc\n```\n\n**Format rules**:\n- One file path per line (relative to `source/`)\n- Lines starting with `#` are comments\n- Empty lines are ignored\n- Patterns are matched exactly (no glob expansion)\n\n**Contract**: Files listed in `.wsdignore` are SKIPPED during staging, not treated as errors.\n\n### Exclusion Precedence\n\n1. Check against `.wsdignore` entries (skip if match)\n2. Check against suspicious file patterns (error if match)\n3. Proceed with staging\n\nThis order allows `.wsdignore` to whitelist files that would otherwise be flagged as suspicious (though in practice, `.wsdignore` entries are specific to WSD Development, not general patterns).\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Target Directory Errors\n\n**Error**: Target directory does not exist\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Target directory does not exist: ../workscope-dev/\nThis directory should be the GitHub repository for rcgray/workscope-dev.\nPlease ensure the repository is cloned to the expected location.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Clone the GitHub repository to the expected location, or use `--target` to specify a different location.\n\n**Error**: Target `.git/` is a symlink\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Target .git/ is a symlink: ../workscope-dev/.git -> /other/repo/.git\nThe .git directory must be a real directory, not a symlink.\nThis may indicate a git worktree or other non-standard setup.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Use a standard git clone for the target repository, or use `--target` to specify a different location.\n\n#### 2. Symlink Errors\n\n**Error**: Symlink detected in source\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Symlink detected in source/: source/scripts/link.py -> ../other.py\nSymlinks are not expected in the WSD Runtime source.\nPlease investigate and resolve before staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Remove the symlink and replace with actual file, or determine why it was created.\n\n**Rationale**: Symlinks are unexpected in `source/` and may indicate accidental file creation or architectural issues.\n\n#### 3. Empty Directory Errors\n\n**Error**: Empty directory detected\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Empty directory detected: source/docs/workbench/\nEmpty directories should contain a .wsdkeep file.\nPlease add .wsdkeep or remove the directory.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Add a `.wsdkeep` placeholder file to the directory, or remove the directory if it is not needed.\n\n**Rationale**: Empty directories should have `.wsdkeep` files to ensure they are tracked by git and preserved during installation.\n\n#### 4. Suspicious File Errors\n\n**Error**: Suspicious file detected\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\nDevelopment artifacts should not exist in source/.\nPlease investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Remove the suspicious file/directory and investigate how it was created (may indicate a Rule 6.1 violation where code changes were made to `source/` instead of running from the development environment properly).\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: Source validation (Phase 3) occurs BEFORE target modification (Phase 4). If any error is detected in `source/` (symlinks, empty directories, suspicious files), the target directory remains completely unchanged.\n\nIf an error occurs during file copying (Phase 5), the target may be in an inconsistent state (cleaned but partially copied). The error message will indicate this.\n\n**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The clean-before-copy behavior ensures the target will be in a consistent state after a successful run.\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe script MUST use Python standard library only:\n- `pathlib` - Path operations\n- `shutil` - File copying with permission preservation\n- `os` - Directory operations\n- `argparse` - Command-line parsing\n\n**Contract**: No external packages required. The script runs with Python 3.10+ (matching WSD requirements).\n\n### Permission Handling\n\nThe script MUST use `shutil.copy2()` for file copying, which preserves file metadata including permission bits.\n\n**Verification**: After staging, the script MUST verify that executable files (those with `+x` in source) retain their executable permission in the target.\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Staging Tests\n\n1. **Default Target Staging**: Run `uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py`, verify files appear in `../workscope-dev/`, verify `.git/` preserved, verify excluded files not present\n\n2. **Custom Target Staging**: Run with `--target /tmp/test-staging`, verify files staged to specified location\n\n3. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no files changed, verify output shows what would be staged\n\n4. **Idempotency**: Run script twice in succession, verify target directory identical after both runs\n\n### Edge Case Tests\n\n1. **Missing Target Directory**: Run against non-existent target, verify clear error message, verify no partial operations\n\n2. **Target Without .git**: Run against valid directory without `.git/`, verify warning displayed but staging proceeds\n\n3. **Empty .wsdignore**: Remove all entries from `.wsdignore`, run staging, verify default exclusions still apply\n\n4. **Symlink Detection**: Create symlink in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n\n5. **Empty Directory Detection**: Create empty directory in `source/` (without `.wsdkeep`), run staging, verify error and halt\n\n6. **Suspicious File Detection**: Create `__pycache__/` in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Release Workflow**: Stage files, then run `build_for_pypi.py` on staged output, verify build succeeds\n\n2. **Permission Preservation**: Stage files including executable scripts, verify `+x` bit preserved on `wsd.py` and scripts\n\n3. **File Count Verification**: Count files in `source/`, count exclusions, verify staged count matches expected\n\n4. **Git Workflow Integration**: Stage files, navigate to target, run `git status`, verify correct files shown as added/modified/deleted\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Standard Staging Operation\n\n**Context**: Developer wants to prepare a release for GitHub publishing.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nCleaning target directory...\n  Preserved: .git/\n  Removed: 127 files, 23 directories\n\nStaging files...\n  STAGE: wsd.py\n  STAGE: wsd.json\n  STAGE: scripts/health_check.py\n  STAGE: scripts/wsd_utils.py\n  SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n  SKIP: .wsdignore (in .wsdignore)\n  STAGE: .claude/agents/task-master.md\n  ...\n\nVerifying staging...\n  File count: 127 staged (2 excluded) - OK\n  Permissions: 8 executable files verified - OK\n\n=== Staging Complete ===\nStaged 127 files to ../workscope-dev/\nNext steps:\n  cd ../workscope-dev\n  git status\n  git add -A && git commit -m \"Release vX.Y.Z\"\n  git push origin main\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The script cleaned the target (preserving `.git/`), copied all source files except those in `.wsdignore`, verified the result, and provided next steps for the developer.\n\n### Example 2: Dry Run Preview\n\n**Context**: Developer wants to see what would be staged without making changes.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging (DRY RUN) ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nPre-scanning source...\n  127 files to stage, 2 to skip\n\nWould clean target directory...\n  Would preserve: .git/\n  Would remove: 127 files, 23 directories\n\nWould stage files...\n  WOULD STAGE: wsd.py\n  WOULD STAGE: wsd.json\n  WOULD SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n  ...\n\n=== Dry Run Complete ===\nNo changes made. Run without --dry-run to perform staging.\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The dry run pre-scans the source to determine exact counts, then shows exactly what would happen without making any changes. This allows the developer to verify before committing to the operation.\n\n### Example 3: Error Scenario - Suspicious File\n\n**Context**: Developer accidentally ran a Python command that created `__pycache__/` in `source/`.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nPre-scanning source...\n\nERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\nDevelopment artifacts should not exist in source/.\nPlease investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The script detected a `__pycache__/` directory during pre-scan (before modifying the target). The target directory remains unchanged. The developer must investigate and remove the artifact before staging can proceed.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Release Managers\n\n1. **Always verify git status after staging**: Run `cd ../workscope-dev && git status` to see exactly what changed before committing.\n\n2. **Review diff for unexpected changes**: Run `git diff` in the staging directory to verify no unintended modifications.\n\n3. **Test dry-run first for major releases**: Use `--dry-run` to preview the staging operation, especially after significant changes to `source/`.\n\n4. **Maintain clean source directory**: Ensure `source/` remains free of development artifacts per Design Decision 9.\n\n### For Developers\n\n1. **Use proper development environment**: Run WSD from the development root, not from within `source/`, to avoid creating artifacts.\n\n2. **Keep .wsdignore minimal**: Only add files that genuinely need to exist in `source/` for development purposes.\n\n3. **Address errors immediately**: If the script halts on a suspicious file, investigate the root cause rather than working around it.\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Describes the pre-staging script that must run before staging to prepare wsd.json with hashes, executable list, and version\n- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Describes PyPI packaging that consumes the staged output; the staging script is a prerequisite to the build process\n- **Design-Decisions.md § Decision 9**: Establishes the principle of keeping WSD Runtime directory pure and ship-ready, which this script enforces\n- **Install-And-Update-Overview.md**: Describes installation behavior that the staged files will exhibit when distributed\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm and format specification\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Schema for wsd.json including file_hashes field\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Stage Release Script including the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and error handling.

It consolidates wsd.json management functionality that was previously split between an agent command (`/update-wsd-json`) and the staging script (`stage_release.py`), moving these operations earlier in the release pipeline so that changes are tracked in the WSD Development repository.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the complete pre-staging process including file collection, validation of metadata arrays, executable list synchronization, hash generation, version auto-increment logic, and wsd.json updates.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context and how the Pre-Staging Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Pre-Staging Script serves five critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Metadata Validation**: Validates that files referenced in `no_overwrite`, `executable`, and `installation_only` arrays still exist in `source/`, preventing metadata drift from the actual file structure\n    20→\n    21→2. **Executable Synchronization**: Synchronizes the `executable` array with actual file permissions by detecting files with the `+x` bit set, ensuring the executable list reflects reality rather than manual maintenance\n    22→\n    23→3. **Hash Generation**: Generates SHA-256 content hashes for all WSD Runtime files (excluding `installation_only` files) and writes them to `source/wsd.json`, enabling repository tracking of file content state\n    24→\n    25→4. **Version Management**: Auto-increments the patch version when any tracked changes are detected (hashes, executable list, or metadata arrays), ensuring version reflects content changes\n    26→\n    27→5. **Pipeline Position Shift**: Moves wsd.json updates from the staging phase (which writes to a target directory) to a pre-staging phase (which writes to `source/`), making all wsd.json changes visible in version control before staging\n    28→\n    29→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of the pre-staging algorithm, validation rules, executable detection logic, version increment triggers, and the relationship to the stage release script.\n    30→\n    31→## Script Architecture\n    32→\n    33→### Script Location\n    34→\n    35→The script lives at `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` in the WSD Development repository.

Determine the correct destination and remove the entry from the other array.\n   699→\n   700→### Error Recovery Principles\n   701→\n   702→**Guarantee**: If any error occurs, `source/wsd.json` remains unchanged. The script validates all inputs before making any modifications.\n   703→\n   704→**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The idempotent design ensures consistent results.\n   705→\n   706→## Design Decisions\n   707→\n   708→### Why Pre-Staging Instead of In-Staging\n   709→\n   710→**Problem**: Previously, hash generation happened in `stage_release.py`, writing hashes to the TARGET directory. This meant:\n   711→- Hashes were never tracked in the WSD Development repository\n   712→- Version bumps during staging were not recorded in source\n   713→- The source wsd.json was always one step behind the staged version\n   714→\n   715→**Solution**: Moving hash generation to a dedicated pre-staging script that writes to `source/wsd.json` ensures all changes are tracked in version control before staging.\n   716→\n   717→**Alternatives Considered:**\n   718→- **Modify stage_release.py to write back to source**: Would create confusing bidirectional data flow and violate single-responsibility\n   719→- **Keep agent command for wsd.json updates**: Agent-driven updates are slow, error-prone, and not deterministic\n   720→\n   721→### Manual Pipeline Execution\n   722→\n   723→Each script in the pipeline runs manually and independently:\n   724→\n   725→```\n   726→pre_staging.py -> stage_release.py -> build_package.py -> validate_package.py\n   727→```\n   728→\n   729→**Rationale**: Each step may require review or intervention. Automatic chaining could mask issues or create unexpected side effects.\n   730→\n   731→### installation_only Is Manual-Add Only\n   732→\n   733→The script NEVER automatically adds files to `installation_only`. It only removes entries for files that no longer exist.\n   734→\n   735→**Rationale**: Adding files to `installation_only` is a significant decision (those files will not be copied during installation). This requires explicit developer intent and should not happen automatically.\n   736→\n   737→## Out of Scope\n   738→\n   739→The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:\n   740→\n   741→1. **Grand Build Script**: A master script that chains pre_staging → stage_release → build_package → validate_package is future work\n   742→2. **Major/Minor Version Bumping**: Only patch version auto-increments; major and minor version changes require manual editing\n   743→3. **installation_only Auto-Detection**: The script does not automatically determine which files should be in `installation_only`\n   744→4. **Cross-Script Validation**: The script does not check if other pipeline scripts have been run; each script owns its responsibilities independently\n   745→\n   746→## Testing Scenarios\n   747→\n   748→### Basic Pre-Staging Tests\n   749→\n   750→1. **Clean Run**: Run on clean source/, verify wsd.json updated with correct hashes and no version bump (if no changes)\n   751→\n   752→2. **Content Change Detection**: Modify a file in source/, run pre-staging, verify hash changes and version increments\n   753→\n   754→3. **New File Detection**: Add new file to source/, run pre-staging, verify hash added and version increments\n   755→\n   756→4. **File Removal Detection**: Delete file from source/, run pre-staging, verify hash removed and version increments\n   757→\n   758→5. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no changes written, verify output shows what would change\n   759→\n   760→### Executable Sync Tests\n   761→\n   762→1. **Add Executable**: Set `+x` on file, run pre-staging, verify file added to executable array\n   763→\n   764→2. **Remove Executable**: Remove `+x` from file, run pre-staging, verify file removed from executable array\n   765→\n   766→3. **Mixed Permissions**: Have files with and without `+x`, verify only +x files in executable array\n   767→\n   768→### Metadata Validation Tests\n   769→\n   770→1. **no_overwrite Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to no_overwrite, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n   771→\n   772→2. **installation_only Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to installation_only, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n   773→\n   774→3. **Valid Metadata**: Run with all valid metadata entries, verify no removals\n   775→\n   776→### Version Increment Tests\n   777→\n   778→1. **No Changes**: Run twice with no file changes, verify version unchanged on second run\n   779→\n   780→2. **Hash Change**: Modify file content, verify patch version increments\n   781→\n   782→3. **Executable Change**: Change file permissions, verify patch version increments\n   783→\n   784→4. **Metadata Cleanup**: Remove file referenced in no_overwrite, verify patch version increments\n   785→\n   786→### Error Handling Tests\n   787→\n   788→1. **Missing wsd.json**: Run with no wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n   789→\n   790→2. **Invalid JSON**: Run with malformed wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n   791→\n   792→3. **Collection Error**: Create __pycache__ in source/, verify error from collect_wsd_files\n   793→\n   794→4. **Permission Error**: Make file unreadable, verify clear error message\n   795→\n   796→### Integration Tests\n   797→\n   798→1. **Full Pipeline**: Run pre_staging.py, then stage_release.py, verify staged wsd.json matches source wsd.json\n   799→\n   800→2. **Idempotency**: Run pre_staging.py twice, verify second run produces no changes\n   801→\n   802→## Best Practices\n   803→\n   804→### For Release Managers\n   805→\n   806→1. **Run Before Staging**: Always run `pre_staging.py` before `stage_release.py` to ensure wsd.json is current\n   807→\n   808→2. **Review Changes**: Check git diff after running to understand what changed in wsd.json\n   809→\n   810→3. **Use Dry Run First**: Run with `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying\n   811→\n   812→### For Developers\n   813→\n   814→1. **Keep source/ Clean**: Ensure no development artifacts exist in source/ before running\n   815→\n   816→2. **Set Permissions Explicitly**: If a file should be executable in the distributed runtime, ensure it has `+x` in source/\n   817→\n   818→3. **Manual Metadata Changes**: To add files to `no_overwrite` or `installation_only`, edit wsd.json manually before running pre_staging.py\n   819→\n   820→## Related Specifications\n   821→\n   822→- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Staging script that runs after pre-staging;

It consolidates wsd.json management functionality that was previously split between an agent command (`/update-wsd-json`) and the staging script (`stage_release.py`), moving these operations earlier in the release pipeline so that changes are tracked in the WSD Development repository.\n\nThis specification defines the complete pre-staging process including file collection, validation of metadata arrays, executable list synchronization, hash generation, version auto-increment logic, and wsd.json updates.\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Pre-Staging Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Pre-Staging Script serves five critical functions:\n\n1. **Metadata Validation**: Validates that files referenced in `no_overwrite`, `executable`, and `installation_only` arrays still exist in `source/`, preventing metadata drift from the actual file structure\n\n2. **Executable Synchronization**: Synchronizes the `executable` array with actual file permissions by detecting files with the `+x` bit set, ensuring the executable list reflects reality rather than manual maintenance\n\n3. **Hash Generation**: Generates SHA-256 content hashes for all WSD Runtime files (excluding `installation_only` files) and writes them to `source/wsd.json`, enabling repository tracking of file content state\n\n4. **Version Management**: Auto-increments the patch version when any tracked changes are detected (hashes, executable list, or metadata arrays), ensuring version reflects content changes\n\n5. **Pipeline Position Shift**: Moves wsd.json updates from the staging phase (which writes to a target directory) to a pre-staging phase (which writes to `source/`), making all wsd.json changes visible in version control before staging\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of the pre-staging algorithm, validation rules, executable detection logic, version increment triggers, and the relationship to the stage release script.\n\n## Script Architecture\n\n### Script Location\n\nThe script lives at `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n\n- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools (like `stage_release.py`)\n- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates ON `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n\n### Command Interface\n\n```bash\n# Run pre-staging with default behavior\nuv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py\n\n# Preview what would change (no writes)\nuv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --dry-run\n\n# Show detailed operation progress\nuv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --verbose\n```\n\n### CLI Flags\n\n| Flag        | Description                                                    |\n| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing to `source/wsd.json`           |\n| `--verbose` | Display detailed progress including individual file operations |\n\n### Exit Codes\n\n| Code | Meaning                                     |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| `0`  | Success (including \"no changes needed\")     |\n| `1`  | Error (validation failure, I/O error, etc.) |\n\n### Behavioral Guarantees\n\n| Aspect            | Behavior                                                              |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Target            | Always operates on `source/wsd.json`                                  |\n| File collection   | Uses `wsd_utils.collect_wsd_files()`                                  |\n| Hash calculation  | Uses `wsd_utils.calculate_file_hash()`                                |\n| Version increment | Auto-increments patch version on any detected change                  |\n| Idempotency       | Running twice with no file changes produces no wsd.json modifications |\n\n## Pipeline Position\n\nThe Pre-Staging Script fits into the release pipeline as follows:\n\n```\nsource/wsd.json (base state)\n        |\n        v\npre_staging.py       <-- VALIDATES, HASHES, VERSION BUMPS\n        |\n        v\nsource/wsd.json (with file_hashes, synced executable, updated version)\n        |\n        v\ngit commit           <-- CHANGES TRACKED IN REPOSITORY\n        |\n        v\nstage_release.py     <-- COPIES FILES AS-IS (no wsd.json modifications)\n        |\n        v\nstaging directory (ready for build_package.py)\n```\n\n**Key Change from Previous Design**: Previously, `stage_release.py` generated hashes and wrote them to the TARGET directory's wsd.json. This meant hashes were never tracked in version control. The pre-staging script moves this work earlier so all wsd.json modifications happen in `source/` and are captured by git.\n\n## Pre-Staging Algorithm\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef pre_staging(source_dir: Path, dry_run: bool = False, verbose: bool = False) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate and update source/wsd.json with hashes, executable list, and version.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to source/ directory\n        dry_run: If True, preview only without making changes\n        verbose: If True, display detailed progress\n\n    Raises:\n        SystemExit: On validation failure or I/O error\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phase 1: Load current wsd.json\n    wsd_json = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    original_state = deep_copy(wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 2: Collect valid files\n    files = collect_wsd_files(source_dir)\n\n    # Phase 2.5: Extract required_directories from .wsdkeep files\n    wsd_json['required_directories'] = extract_required_directories(files)\n    validate_required_directories(wsd_json['required_directories'], files, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 3: Validate metadata arrays\n    validate_no_overwrite_exists(wsd_json, files, verbose)\n    validate_installation_only_exists(wsd_json, verbose)\n    validate_executable_exists(wsd_json, files, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 4: Sync executable list from actual permissions\n    wsd_json['executable'] = sync_executable_list(files, source_dir, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 5: Generate file hashes (excluding installation_only and .wsdkeep)\n    installation_only = set(wsd_json.get('installation_only', []))\n    wsd_json['file_hashes'] = generate_file_hashes(files, source_dir, installation_only)\n\n    # Phase 5.5: Validate manifest exclusivity\n    validate_manifest_exclusivity(wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 6: Check for changes and bump version if needed\n    if has_changes(original_state, wsd_json):\n        wsd_json['version'] = increment_patch_version(wsd_json['version'])\n\n    # Phase 7: Write updated wsd.json (unless dry-run)\n    if not dry_run:\n        write_wsd_json(source_dir, wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 8: Generate summary report\n    generate_summary(original_state, wsd_json, dry_run)\n```\n\n### Phase Details\n\n#### Phase 1: Load Current wsd.json\n\nThe script MUST load and parse the existing `source/wsd.json` file:\n\n```python\ndef load_wsd_json(source_dir: Path) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Load wsd.json from source directory.\"\"\"\n    wsd_json_path = source_dir / \"wsd.json\"\n\n    if not wsd_json_path.exists():\n        raise SystemExit(\"ERROR: source/wsd.json does not exist\")\n\n    with wsd_json_path.open(encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n```\n\n**Error Handling**: If wsd.json does not exist or cannot be parsed, the script MUST exit with a clear error message.\n\n#### Phase 2: Collect Valid Files\n\nThe script MUST use `wsd_utils.collect_wsd_files()` to obtain the list of valid files in `source/`:\n\n```python\nfrom wsd_utils import collect_wsd_files, WsdCollectionError\n\ntry:\n    files = collect_wsd_files(source_dir)\nexcept WsdCollectionError as e:\n    raise SystemExit(f\"ERROR: {e.message}\")\n```\n\nThis function handles:\n- Suspicious file detection (development artifacts)\n- Symlink detection\n- Empty directory detection\n- .wsdignore exclusions\n- Binary file detection\n\nFor complete file collection specification, see **wsd_utils.py** documentation.\n\n#### Phase 2.5: Extract and Validate required_directories\n\nThe script MUST extract directory paths from .wsdkeep files and populate the `required_directories` array:\n\n```python\ndef extract_required_directories(files: list[Path]) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Extract required directory paths from .wsdkeep files.\n\n    Scans the collected files for .wsdkeep placeholder files and extracts\n    the parent directory path for each. These directories represent locations\n    that must exist in target projects during installation.\n\n    Args:\n        files: List of collected file paths relative to source directory.\n\n    Returns:\n        Sorted list of directory paths (without trailing slashes) derived\n        from .wsdkeep file locations. For example, 'docs/workbench/.wsdkeep'\n        yields 'docs/workbench'.\n    \"\"\"\n    directories: set[str] = set()\n\n    for file_path in files:\n        if file_path.name == \".wsdkeep\":\n            # Get the parent directory path\n            parent_dir = str(file_path.parent)\n            # Normalize path separators for cross-platform consistency\n            parent_dir = parent_dir.replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")\n            # Handle edge case where .wsdkeep is at root (parent would be '.')\n            if parent_dir and parent_dir != \".\":\n                directories.add(parent_dir)\n\n    return sorted(directories)\n```\n\n**Extraction Rules:**\n\n1. **Detection**: Scan all collected files for `.wsdkeep` filename\n2. **Parent Path**: Extract the parent directory path from each .wsdkeep location\n3. **Normalization**: Convert backslashes to forward slashes for cross-platform consistency\n4. **Sorting**: Return sorted list for deterministic output and git-friendly diffs\n5. **Root Exclusion**: Skip .wsdkeep files at root level (parent path would be '.')\n\n**Example Extraction:**\n```\nInput files:\n  docs/workbench/.wsdkeep\n  dev/diagnostics/.wsdkeep\n  docs/tickets/open/.wsdkeep\n\nOutput required_directories:\n  [\"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\", \"docs/workbench\"]\n```\n\nAfter extraction, the script MUST validate referential integrity:\n\n```python\ndef validate_required_directories(\n    required_directories: list[str],\n    files: list[Path],\n    verbose: bool = False,\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate that all required_directories have corresponding .wsdkeep files.\n\n    Ensures referential integrity by verifying that each directory in\n    required_directories corresponds to an actual .wsdkeep file in the\n    collected files list.\n\n    Args:\n        required_directories: List of directory paths to validate.\n        files: List of collected file paths relative to source directory.\n        verbose: If True, log validation status.\n\n    Raises:\n        SystemExit: If any directory has no corresponding .wsdkeep file.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Build set of directories that have .wsdkeep files\n    wsdkeep_dirs = {\n        str(f.parent).replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")\n        for f in files\n        if f.name == \".wsdkeep\" and str(f.parent) != \".\"\n    }\n\n    # Check for orphaned directories (in required_directories but no .wsdkeep)\n    orphaned = set(required_directories) - wsdkeep_dirs\n\n    if orphaned:\n        print(\"ERROR: required_directories entries have no corresponding .wsdkeep file:\")\n        for path in sorted(orphaned):\n            print(f\"  - {path}\")\n        print(\"\\nThese directories should have .wsdkeep files in source/\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"  required_directories: {len(required_directories)} entries validated\")\n```\n\n**Validation Rules:**\n\n1. **Referential Integrity**: Every entry in `required_directories` must have a corresponding `.wsdkeep` file\n2. **Error on Orphans**: If any directory lacks a .wsdkeep file, exit with error listing all orphaned entries\n3. **Verbose Logging**: Report validation success when verbose mode enabled\n\n**Rationale**: This validation prevents metadata drift where `required_directories` claims a directory is required but no .wsdkeep file exists in source/ to mark it.\n\n#### Phase 3: Validate Metadata Arrays\n\nThe script MUST validate metadata arrays according to their modification policies:\n\n**no_overwrite Validation:**\n```python\ndef validate_no_overwrite_exists(\n    wsd_json: dict,\n    files: list[Path],\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate all no_overwrite entries exist in collected files.\"\"\"\n    no_overwrite = set(wsd_json.get('no_overwrite', []))\n    file_paths = {str(f) for f in files}\n\n    missing = no_overwrite - file_paths\n    if missing:\n        # Remove missing entries (file was deleted)\n        wsd_json['no_overwrite'] = [f for f in wsd_json['no_overwrite'] if f not in missing]\n        print(f\"WARNING: Removed {len(missing)} missing files from no_overwrite: {sorted(missing)}\")\n    elif verbose:\n        print(f\"  no_overwrite: {len(no_overwrite)} entries validated\")\n```\n\n**installation_only Validation:**\n```python\ndef validate_installation_only_exists(\n    wsd_json: dict,\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate installation_only array without modification.\n\n    The installation_only array is manually managed and may contain files that\n    don't exist yet (build-time generated files). This function only validates\n    that the array is present and well-formed, without adding or removing entries.\n    \"\"\"\n    installation_only = wsd_json.get('installation_only', [])\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"  installation_only: {len(installation_only)} entries (manual management only)\")\n```\n\n**executable Validation:**\n```python\ndef validate_executable_exists(\n    wsd_json: dict,\n    files: list[Path],\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate all executable entries exist in collected files.\"\"\"\n    executable = set(wsd_json.get('executable', []))\n    file_paths = {str(f) for f in files}\n\n    missing = executable - file_paths\n    if missing:\n        wsd_json['executable'] = [f for f in wsd_json['executable'] if f not in missing]\n        print(f\"WARNING: Removed {len(missing)} missing files from executable: {sorted(missing)}\")\n    elif verbose:\n        print(f\"  executable: {len(executable)} entries validated\")\n```\n\n**Validation Rules:**\n\n1. **no_overwrite**: Files that no longer exist are automatically REMOVED from the array\n2. **installation_only**: Array is NEVER modified (manually managed, may contain build-time files)\n3. **executable**: Files that no longer exist are automatically REMOVED before sync\n\n**Design Constraints**:\n- The script MUST NOT automatically ADD files to no_overwrite or installation_only (manual operations only)\n- The script MUST NOT modify installation_only at all (files may be build-time generated)\n- The executable array is completely regenerated in Phase 4, so validation here only provides logging\n\n#### Phase 4: Sync Executable List\n\nThe script MUST synchronize the `executable` array with actual file permissions:\n\n```python\nimport stat\n\ndef sync_executable_list(\n    files: list[Path],\n    source_dir: Path,\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Build executable list from actual file permissions.\n\n    Returns list of relative paths for files with +x bit set.\n    \"\"\"\n    executable = []\n\n    for relative_path in files:\n        file_path = source_dir / relative_path\n        try:\n            mode = file_path.stat().st_mode\n            if mode & (stat.S_IXUSR | stat.S_IXGRP | stat.S_IXOTH):\n                executable.append(str(relative_path))\n                if verbose:\n                    print(f\"  Detected executable: {relative_path}\")\n        except OSError:\n            continue\n\n    return sorted(executable)\n```\n\n**Executable Detection Rules:**\n\n1. **Detection**: A file is executable if ANY executable bit is set (user, group, or other)\n2. **Sync Behavior**: The executable array is completely regenerated from file permissions\n3. **Additions**: Files with `+x` bit are added to the array\n4. **Removals**: Files without `+x` bit (or that no longer exist) are removed from the array\n\n**Note on Interpreter-Invoked Scripts**: Files invoked via interpreters (e.g., `uv run python script.py`) do not need the `+x` bit. Only files intended to be directly executed need executable permissions.\n\n#### Phase 5: Generate File Hashes\n\nThe script MUST generate content hashes for all files except those in `installation_only` and .wsdkeep files:\n\n```python\nfrom wsd_utils import calculate_file_hash\n\ndef generate_file_hashes(\n    files: list[Path],\n    source_dir: Path,\n    installation_only: set[str],\n    verbose: bool = False,\n) -> dict[str, str]:\n    \"\"\"Generate SHA-256 hashes for all files except installation_only and .wsdkeep.\n\n    Calculates content hashes for WSD Runtime files, excluding:\n    - Files listed in the installation_only array (not copied during installation)\n    - .wsdkeep placeholder files (tracked via required_directories instead)\n\n    Args:\n        files: List of collected file paths relative to source directory.\n        source_dir: Path to the source/ directory for file access.\n        installation_only: Set of file paths to exclude from hashing.\n        verbose: If True, log individual hash operations.\n\n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping relative paths (with forward slashes) to hash strings\n        in format 'sha256:<hex_digest>'.\n    \"\"\"\n    file_hashes: dict[str, str] = {}\n\n    for relative_path in files:\n        # Convert to forward-slash path for cross-platform consistency\n        path_str = str(relative_path).replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")\n\n        # Skip files in installation_only\n        if path_str in installation_only:\n            if verbose:\n                print(f\"  Skipping (installation_only): {path_str}\")\n            continue\n\n        # Skip .wsdkeep files (tracked via required_directories)\n        if relative_path.name == \".wsdkeep\":\n            if verbose:\n                print(f\"  Skipping (.wsdkeep): {path_str}\")\n            continue\n\n        file_path = source_dir / relative_path\n        file_hashes[path_str] = calculate_file_hash(file_path)\n\n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"  Hashed: {path_str}\")\n\n    return file_hashes\n```\n\n**Hash Generation Rules:**\n\n1. **Algorithm**: SHA-256 via `wsd_utils.calculate_file_hash()`\n2. **Format**: `sha256:<64_lowercase_hex_chars>`\n3. **Exclusions**:\n   - Files in `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (not copied during installation)\n   - `.wsdkeep` files are NOT hashed (tracked via `required_directories` instead)\n4. **Path Format**: Forward slashes for cross-platform consistency\n5. **Verbose Logging**: Report skipped files and hashed files when verbose mode enabled\n\nFor complete hash calculation specification, see **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n#### Phase 5.5: Validate Manifest Exclusivity\n\nThe script MUST validate that `installation_only` and `file_hashes` are mutually exclusive:\n\n```python\ndef validate_manifest_exclusivity(wsd_json: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate that installation_only and file_hashes are mutually exclusive.\n\n    Ensures no file paths appear in both the installation_only list and\n    file_hashes dictionary keys. These fields represent semantically opposite\n    destinations: installation_only files are NOT copied to user projects,\n    while file_hashes files ARE copied with hash verification.\n    \"\"\"\n    installation_only = set(wsd_json.get('installation_only', []))\n    file_hashes = set(wsd_json.get('file_hashes', {}).keys())\n\n    overlap = installation_only & file_hashes\n    if overlap:\n        print(\"ERROR: Files cannot appear in both installation_only and file_hashes:\")\n        for path in sorted(overlap):\n            print(f\"  - {path}\")\n        print(\"\\nRemove duplicates from installation_only or file_hashes.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n**Mutual Exclusivity Rules:**\n\n1. **Semantic Conflict**: Files in `installation_only` are NOT copied to user projects, while files in `file_hashes` ARE copied. A file cannot have both behaviors.\n2. **Validation Timing**: Validation occurs after hash generation to catch any conflicting entries before writing to wsd.json.\n3. **Exit on Conflict**: If any overlap is detected, the script MUST exit with code 1 and list all conflicting files.\n\n#### Phase 6: Change Detection and Version Increment\n\nThe script MUST detect changes and auto-increment the patch version:\n\n```python\ndef has_changes(original: dict, current: dict) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Detect if any tracked fields have changed.\n\n    Compares the original and current wsd.json states to determine if\n    any changes were made that should trigger a version increment.\n\n    Args:\n        original: Original wsd.json state before modifications.\n        current: Current wsd.json state after modifications.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if any tracked field differs, False if identical.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compare file_hashes dictionaries\n    if original.get('file_hashes', {}) != current.get('file_hashes', {}):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare executable arrays (sorted for order-independent comparison)\n    if sorted(original.get('executable', [])) != sorted(current.get('executable', [])):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare no_overwrite arrays\n    if sorted(original.get('no_overwrite', [])) != sorted(current.get('no_overwrite', [])):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare installation_only arrays\n    if sorted(original.get('installation_only', [])) != sorted(current.get('installation_only', [])):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare required_directories arrays\n    return sorted(original.get('required_directories', [])) != sorted(current.get('required_directories', []))\n\n\ndef increment_patch_version(version: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Increment patch version (X.Y.Z -> X.Y.Z+1).\"\"\"\n    parts = version.split('.')\n    parts[2] = str(int(parts[2]) + 1)\n    return '.'.join(parts)\n```\n\n**Version Increment Triggers:**\n\nThe patch version MUST be incremented when ANY of the following change:\n\n| Field                   | Change Type                                     |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| `file_hashes`           | Files added, removed, or content changed        |\n| `executable`            | Files added or removed from list                |\n| `no_overwrite`          | Files removed (because they no longer exist)    |\n| `installation_only`     | Files removed (because they no longer exist)    |\n| `required_directories`  | Directories added or removed from list          |\n\n**Version Format**: Semantic versioning `X.Y.Z` where only the patch version (Z) is auto-incremented. Major and minor version changes are manual operations.\n\n#### Phase 7: Write Updated wsd.json\n\nUnless in dry-run mode, the script MUST write the updated wsd.json:\n\n```python\ndef write_wsd_json(source_dir: Path, wsd_json: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Write updated wsd.json to source directory.\"\"\"\n    wsd_json_path = source_dir / \"wsd.json\"\n\n    with wsd_json_path.open('w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        json.dump(wsd_json, f, indent=2)\n        f.write('\\n')  # Trailing newline\n```\n\n**Write Guarantees:**\n\n1. **Atomic**: Write completes fully or fails completely\n2. **Formatting**: JSON with 2-space indentation\n3. **Trailing Newline**: File ends with a single newline character\n\n#### Phase 8: Generate Summary Report\n\nThe script MUST generate a summary of operations performed:\n\n```\n=== Pre-Staging Complete ===\nVersion: 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 (patch bump due to changes)\n\nChanges:\n  File hashes: 127 files hashed (3 changed, 1 added, 0 removed)\n  Executable: 8 files (0 added, 0 removed)\n  Required directories: 14 directories (0 added, 0 removed)\n  no_overwrite: 12 files (0 removed)\n  installation_only: 2 files (0 removed)\n\nUpdated source/wsd.json\n```\n\nFor dry-run mode:\n\n```\n=== Pre-Staging Preview (Dry Run) ===\nVersion: 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 (would bump due to changes)\n\nChanges detected:\n  File hashes: 3 files changed, 1 added, 0 removed\n  Executable: No changes\n  Required directories: No changes\n  no_overwrite: No changes\n  installation_only: No changes\n\nNo changes written. Run without --dry-run to apply.\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Missing wsd.json\n\n**Error:** `source/wsd.json` does not exist\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: source/wsd.json does not exist\nCannot run pre-staging without an existing wsd.json file.\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Create wsd.json manually with at least the required `version` field.\n\n#### 2. Invalid wsd.json\n\n**Error:** `source/wsd.json` cannot be parsed as JSON\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Failed to parse source/wsd.json\nJSON decode error at line 15: Expecting ',' delimiter\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Fix the JSON syntax error in wsd.json.\n\n#### 3. File Collection Errors\n\n**Error:** `collect_wsd_files()` raises `WsdCollectionError`\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Development artifact directory detected: source/__pycache__/\nPlease clean source/ directory before running pre-staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Remove the development artifact and re-run.\n\n#### 4. Permission Errors\n\n**Error:** Cannot read file for hashing or permission detection\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Cannot read file: source/scripts/health_check.py\nReason: Permission denied\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Fix file permissions and re-run.\n\n#### 5. Manifest Exclusivity Violation\n\n**Error:** A file appears in both `installation_only` and `file_hashes`\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Files cannot appear in both installation_only and file_hashes:\n  - wsd.json\n  - scripts/build_tool.py\n\nRemove duplicates from installation_only or file_hashes.\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Edit `source/wsd.json` to remove the conflicting file from either `installation_only` or `file_hashes`. A file in `installation_only` is NOT copied to user projects (development-only), while a file in `file_hashes` IS copied with hash verification. Determine the correct destination and remove the entry from the other array.\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: If any error occurs, `source/wsd.json` remains unchanged. The script validates all inputs before making any modifications.\n\n**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The idempotent design ensures consistent results.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Pre-Staging Instead of In-Staging\n\n**Problem**: Previously, hash generation happened in `stage_release.py`, writing hashes to the TARGET directory. This meant:\n- Hashes were never tracked in the WSD Development repository\n- Version bumps during staging were not recorded in source\n- The source wsd.json was always one step behind the staged version\n\n**Solution**: Moving hash generation to a dedicated pre-staging script that writes to `source/wsd.json` ensures all changes are tracked in version control before staging.\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- **Modify stage_release.py to write back to source**: Would create confusing bidirectional data flow and violate single-responsibility\n- **Keep agent command for wsd.json updates**: Agent-driven updates are slow, error-prone, and not deterministic\n\n### Manual Pipeline Execution\n\nEach script in the pipeline runs manually and independently:\n\n```\npre_staging.py -> stage_release.py -> build_package.py -> validate_package.py\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Each step may require review or intervention. Automatic chaining could mask issues or create unexpected side effects.\n\n### installation_only Is Manual-Add Only\n\nThe script NEVER automatically adds files to `installation_only`. It only removes entries for files that no longer exist.\n\n**Rationale**: Adding files to `installation_only` is a significant decision (those files will not be copied during installation). This requires explicit developer intent and should not happen automatically.\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:\n\n1. **Grand Build Script**: A master script that chains pre_staging → stage_release → build_package → validate_package is future work\n2. **Major/Minor Version Bumping**: Only patch version auto-increments; major and minor version changes require manual editing\n3. **installation_only Auto-Detection**: The script does not automatically determine which files should be in `installation_only`\n4. **Cross-Script Validation**: The script does not check if other pipeline scripts have been run; each script owns its responsibilities independently\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Pre-Staging Tests\n\n1. **Clean Run**: Run on clean source/, verify wsd.json updated with correct hashes and no version bump (if no changes)\n\n2. **Content Change Detection**: Modify a file in source/, run pre-staging, verify hash changes and version increments\n\n3. **New File Detection**: Add new file to source/, run pre-staging, verify hash added and version increments\n\n4. **File Removal Detection**: Delete file from source/, run pre-staging, verify hash removed and version increments\n\n5. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no changes written, verify output shows what would change\n\n### Executable Sync Tests\n\n1. **Add Executable**: Set `+x` on file, run pre-staging, verify file added to executable array\n\n2. **Remove Executable**: Remove `+x` from file, run pre-staging, verify file removed from executable array\n\n3. **Mixed Permissions**: Have files with and without `+x`, verify only +x files in executable array\n\n### Metadata Validation Tests\n\n1. **no_overwrite Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to no_overwrite, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n\n2. **installation_only Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to installation_only, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n\n3. **Valid Metadata**: Run with all valid metadata entries, verify no removals\n\n### Version Increment Tests\n\n1. **No Changes**: Run twice with no file changes, verify version unchanged on second run\n\n2. **Hash Change**: Modify file content, verify patch version increments\n\n3. **Executable Change**: Change file permissions, verify patch version increments\n\n4. **Metadata Cleanup**: Remove file referenced in no_overwrite, verify patch version increments\n\n### Error Handling Tests\n\n1. **Missing wsd.json**: Run with no wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n\n2. **Invalid JSON**: Run with malformed wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n\n3. **Collection Error**: Create __pycache__ in source/, verify error from collect_wsd_files\n\n4. **Permission Error**: Make file unreadable, verify clear error message\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Pipeline**: Run pre_staging.py, then stage_release.py, verify staged wsd.json matches source wsd.json\n\n2. **Idempotency**: Run pre_staging.py twice, verify second run produces no changes\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Release Managers\n\n1. **Run Before Staging**: Always run `pre_staging.py` before `stage_release.py` to ensure wsd.json is current\n\n2. **Review Changes**: Check git diff after running to understand what changed in wsd.json\n\n3. **Use Dry Run First**: Run with `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying\n\n### For Developers\n\n1. **Keep source/ Clean**: Ensure no development artifacts exist in source/ before running\n\n2. **Set Permissions Explicitly**: If a file should be executable in the distributed runtime, ensure it has `+x` in source/\n\n3. **Manual Metadata Changes**: To add files to `no_overwrite` or `installation_only`, edit wsd.json manually before running pre_staging.py\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Staging script that runs after pre-staging; will be simplified to remove hash generation\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm and usage; will be updated to reference pre_staging.py\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Schema for wsd.json including all fields managed by pre_staging.py\n- **Design-Decisions.md § Decision 11**: WSD Development scripts in dev/scripts/ are separate from dogfood\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Pre-Staging Script including the pre-staging algorithm, validation rules, executable synchronization, hash generation, and version increment logic. All implementations must conform to these specifications.*\n\n## Feature Implementation Plan (FIP)\n\n**Important**: This is a script specifically for the WSD Development project and is NOT part of the WSD Runtime.

It provides a robust mechanism for copying WSD Runtime files from the WSD Runtime root directory to a target project directory, while detecting and preventing file collisions, managing empty directory structures, creating tracking manifests, and preserving file permissions.\n\nThis specification defines the complete installation process for both fresh installations (into new or empty directories) and integration installations (into existing projects with potential file conflicts).\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Installation System integrates with other WSD components, see System-Architecture.md.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Installation System serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Safe Deployment**: Copies WSD Runtime templates to target projects without overwriting existing files\n2. **Collision Detection**: Identifies and reports conflicts before any files are modified\n3. **Structure Management**: Creates necessary directory hierarchies and maintains empty directories via .wsdkeep files\n4. **Tracking Initialization**: Creates the .wsd manifest file that enables future updates\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of installation procedures, collision detection algorithms, manifest creation, and error handling.\n\n## Installation Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Target Directory Does Not Exist\n\n**Context**: Installing WSD when the target path doesn't exist yet.\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/new-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory does not exist\n- User has write permissions to parent directory\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Create target directory\n2. Verify no .wsd manifest exists (guaranteed - directory just created)\n3. Copy all files from WSD Runtime root to target directory (excluding wsd.json)\n4. Set execute permissions on script files\n5. Create .wsd manifest file\n6. Report success\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- Target directory created\n- All template files copied\n- Directory structure established with .wsdkeep files\n- Execute permissions set on scripts\n- .wsd manifest created\n- Installation completes successfully\n\n### Scenario 2: Target Directory Exists and Is Empty\n\n**Context**: Installing WSD into an existing but empty directory (may contain non-WSD files like .git).\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/existing-empty-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory exists\n- No .wsd manifest exists\n- No files conflict with WSD template files\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Verify no .wsd manifest exists\n2. Perform collision detection (finds no conflicts)\n3. Copy all files from WSD Runtime root to target directory (excluding wsd.json)\n4. Set execute permissions on script files\n5. Create .wsd manifest file\n6. Report success\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- All template files copied\n- Any existing non-WSD files remain untouched\n- WSD structure integrates alongside existing files\n- Installation completes successfully\n\n### Scenario 3: Target Directory Has File Conflicts\n\n**Context**: Installing WSD into a directory containing files that would be overwritten by WSD templates.\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/existing-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory exists\n- No .wsd manifest exists (not a WSD-managed project)\n- One or more files conflict with WSD template files\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Verify no .wsd manifest exists\n2. Perform collision detection\n3. Detect conflicts (e.g., existing README.md, scripts/health_check.py)\n4. **HALT**: Report all collisions to user\n5. Exit with error code\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- No files copied or modified\n- Clear error message listing all collisions\n- User must resolve conflicts before installation\n- Installation aborted (atomic operation)\n\n**Example Error Output**:\n```\nError: Installation aborted due to file collisions.\n\nThe following files exist with different content:\n  - README.md (content differs from WSD template)\n  - scripts/health_check.py (content differs from WSD template)\n  - docs/core/Action-Plan.md (content differs from WSD template)\n\nPlease resolve these conflicts before installing WSD:\n  1. Rename or move existing files\n  2. Delete files if they can be replaced by WSD templates\n  3. Use --force to overwrite all conflicting files\n\nAfter resolving conflicts, retry: wsd.py install /path/to/existing-project\n```\n\n### Scenario 4: WSD Already Installed (Update Needed)\n\n**Context**: Attempting fresh installation when .wsd manifest already exists.\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/wsd-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory exists\n- .wsd manifest file exists (indicates previous WSD installation)\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Detect existing .wsd manifest\n2. **HALT**: Redirect to update mechanism\n3. Exit with informative message\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- No files modified\n- Clear message indicating WSD already installed\n- User directed to use update command instead\n- Installation aborted\n\n**Example Output**:\n```\nError: WSD already installed in this directory.\n\nFound existing .wsd manifest.\n\nTo update your WSD installation, use:\n  wsd.py update /path/to/wsd-project\n\nTo force a fresh installation (WARNING: will overwrite all WSD files):\n  wsd.py install --force /path/to/wsd-project\n```\n\n## Idempotent Installation\n\n### Overview\n\nThe WSD Installation System implements idempotent behavior, meaning that running the install command multiple times produces the same result as running it once. This is achieved through content hash comparison during the installation process.\n\nWhen files already exist in the target directory with content identical to the WSD template files, the installation system skips copying those files. This provides several benefits:\n\n1. **Efficiency**: No unnecessary file I/O operations when content already matches\n2. **Safety**: File modification timestamps are preserved for unchanged files\n3. **Self-Healing**: Incomplete installations are automatically completed on subsequent install attempts\n4. **Determinism**: The same operation always produces the same result\n\n### Behavior\n\nDuring installation, the collision detection algorithm categorizes existing files into two groups:\n\n**True Collisions**: Files that exist with different content than the WSD template. These block installation unless `--force` is specified.\n\n**False Positives**: Files that exist with identical content to the WSD template.

During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n   173→   173→\n   174→   174→**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n   175→   175→\n   176→   176→### required_directories\n   177→   177→\n   178→   178→**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n   179→   179→**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n   180→   180→**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n   181→   181→\n   182→   182→**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n   183→   183→\n   184→   184→**How It Works**:\n   185→   185→- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n   186→   186→- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n   187→   187→- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n   188→   188→- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n   189→   189→\n   190→   190→**Path Requirements**:\n   191→   191→- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n   192→   192→- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n   193→   193→- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n   194→   194→- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n   195→   195→\n   196→   196→**Why This Design**:\n   197→   197→- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n   198→   198→- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n   199→   199→- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n   200→   200→- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n   201→   201→\n   202→   202→**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n   203→   203→\n   204→   204→## Key Concepts\n   205→   205→\n   206→   206→**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest.

During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n   173→\n   174→**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n   175→\n   176→### required_directories\n   177→\n   178→**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n   179→**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n   180→**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n   181→\n   182→**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n   183→\n   184→**How It Works**:\n   185→- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n   186→- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n   187→- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n   188→- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n   189→\n   190→**Path Requirements**:\n   191→- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n   192→- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n   193→- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n   194→- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n   195→\n   196→**Why This Design**:\n   197→- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n   198→- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n   199→- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n   200→- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n   201→\n   202→**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n   203→\n   204→## Key Concepts\n   205→\n   206→**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest.

The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n    48→    48→\n    49→    49→**Derivation Formula**:\n    50→    50→- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n    51→    51→- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n    52→    52→\n    53→    53→**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n    54→    54→\n    55→    55→### Why Two Categories\n    56→    56→\n    57→    57→**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n    58→    58→\n    59→    59→**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n    60→    60→\n    61→    61→**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n    62→    62→\n    63→    63→### File List Retrieval Pattern\n    64→    64→\n    65→    65→Each component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n    66→    66→\n    67→    67→**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n    68→    68→```python\n    69→    69→metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\n    70→    70→files = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n    71→    71→```\n    72→    72→\n    73→    73→**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n    74→    74→```python\n    75→    75→metadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    76→    76→file_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\n    77→    77→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n    78→    78→```\n    79→    79→\n    80→    80→### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n    81→    81→\n    82→    82→Per project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n    83→    83→\n    84→    84→Local helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n    85→    85→\n    86→    86→### Manifest Trust Model\n    87→    87→\n    88→    88→**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error.

Missing File During Copy\n   176→   176→\n   177→   177→**Error**: A file listed in `file_hashes` does not exist on disk\n   178→   178→\n   179→   179→**Example Message**:\n   180→   180→```\n   181→   181→Error: Cannot copy file: /path/to/source/.claude/agents/task-master.md\n   182→   182→File is listed in wsd.json but does not exist.\n   183→   183→This may indicate the manifest is out of sync with the filesystem.\n   184→   184→Run pre_staging.py to resynchronize.\n   185→   185→```\n   186→   186→\n   187→   187→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to rescan and update the manifest.\n   188→   188→\n   189→   189→#### 4. Missing Hash Entry During Update\n   190→   190→\n   191→   191→**Error**: During install or update, a file path has no corresponding entry in `file_hashes`\n   192→   192→\n   193→   193→**Example Message**:\n   194→   194→```\n   195→   195→Error: Missing hash for 'scripts/health_check.py' in wsd.json manifest.\n   196→   196→The manifest may be out of sync with source files.\n   197→   197→Regenerate wsd.json with pre_staging.py.\n   198→   198→```\n   199→   199→\n   200→   200→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to regenerate the manifest with current file hashes.\n   201→   201→\n   202→   202→### Error Recovery Principles\n   203→   203→\n   204→   204→**Guarantee**: If the manifest is missing or malformed, operations fail fast with clear instructions to run `pre_staging.py`.\n   205→   205→\n   206→   206→**Contract**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT attempt to regenerate the manifest themselves. The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n   207→   207→\n   208→   208→## Design Decisions\n   209→   209→\n   210→   210→### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n   211→   211→\n   212→   212→**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n   213→   213→\n   214→   214→1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n   215→   215→2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n   216→   216→3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n   217→   217→4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n   218→   218→\n   219→   219→**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n   220→   220→\n   221→   221→1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n   222→   222→2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n   223→   223→3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n   224→   224→4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n   225→   225→\n   226→   226→### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n   227→   227→\n   228→   228→Per Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n   229→   229→\n   230→   230→**Rationale**:\n   231→   231→- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n   232→   232→- No complex logic to encapsulate\n   233→   233→- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n   234→   234→- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n   235→   235→\n   236→   236→### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n   237→   237→\n   238→   238→`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n   239→   239→\n   240→   240→**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n   241→   241→```python\n   242→   242→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n   243→   243→```\n   244→   244→\n   245→   245→This is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n   246→   246→\n   247→   247→## Testing Scenarios\n   248→   248→\n   249→   249→**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories. Example:\n   250→   250→```python\n   251→   251→# CORRECT:\n   252→   252→sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"source\" / \"scripts\"))\n   253→   253→\n   254→   254→# INCORRECT:\n   255→   255→sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"scripts\"))\n   256→   256→```\n   257→   257→\n   258→   258→### Basic Manifest Reading Tests\n   259→   259→\n   260→   260→1. **Valid Manifest Reading**: Read file list from valid `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, verify list matches manifest keys\n   261→   261→\n   262→   262→2. **Stageable File List**: Get stageable files, verify `wsd.json` is included alongside `file_hashes.keys()`\n   263→   263→\n   264→   264→3. **Installable File List**: Get installable files, verify `wsd.json` is NOT included\n   265→   265→\n   266→   266→### Error Handling Tests\n   267→   267→\n   268→   268→1. **Missing wsd.json**: Attempt to read manifest from directory without `wsd.json`, verify clear error and instructions\n   269→   269→\n   270→   270→2. **Missing file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` without `file_hashes` field, verify error points to `pre_staging.py`\n   271→   271→\n   272→   272→3. **Empty file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` with empty `file_hashes`, verify error is raised (empty file_hashes is never valid)\n   273→   273→\n   274→   274→### Integration Tests\n   275→   275→\n   276→   276→1. **Full Pipeline Flow**: Run `pre_staging.py`, then `stage_release.py`, then `build_package.py`, verify all stages use manifest file list\n   277→   277→\n   278→   278→2. **Staged File Verification**: After staging, verify staged files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`\n   279→   279→\n   280→   280→3. **Install File Verification**: After install, verify installed files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` (without `wsd.json`)\n   281→   281→\n   282→   282→4. **Update File Verification**: Run update operation, verify file categorization uses manifest-based file list\n   283→   283→\n   284→   284→### Regression Tests\n   285→   285→\n   286→   286→1. **No collect_wsd_files Calls**: After implementation, grep codebase to verify `collect_wsd_files()` only called in `pre_staging.py`\n   287→   287→\n   288→   288→2. **Exclusion Consistency**: Verify files excluded by `pre_staging.py` (via `.wsdignore`, suspicious patterns) are consistently absent from all pipeline stages\n   289→   289→\n   290→   290→## Best Practices\n   291→   291→\n   292→   292→### For Pipeline Script Maintainers\n   293→   293→\n   294→   294→1. **Never Add New Scanning**: If you need a file list, read it from the manifest. Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n   295→   295→\n   296→   296→2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n   297→   297→\n   298→   298→3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n   299→   299→\n   300→   300→### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n   301→   301→\n   302→   302→1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n   303→   303→\n   304→   304→2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n   305→   305→\n   306→   306→3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n   307→   307→\n   308→   308→## Related Specifications\n   309→   309→\n   310→   310→- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n   311→   311→- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n   312→   312→- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n   313→   313→- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n   314→   314→- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n   315→   315→- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n   316→   316→\n   317→   317→---\n   318→   318→\n   319→   319→*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling.

After the Pre-Staging-Script feature populates `source/wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, all subsequent pipeline stages read their file lists from the manifest instead of re-scanning the filesystem using `collect_wsd_files()`.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the manifest-based file list retrieval pattern, the pipeline stages that must adopt it, the distinction between installable and stageable file lists, and the migration path from empirical scanning to manifest-driven operations.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context on the WSD distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Manifest-Driven Pipeline serves four critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes `file_hashes.keys()` from `wsd.json` as the authoritative list of WSD Runtime files, eliminating redundant scanning logic across pipeline stages\n    20→\n    21→2. **Consistency Guarantee**: Ensures all pipeline stages operate on the same file list, preventing subtle bugs from differing exclusion rule implementations or race conditions between stages\n    22→\n    23→3. **Simplification**: Removes duplicated `collect_wsd_files()` calls from multiple scripts, reducing code complexity and maintenance burden\n    24→\n    25→4. **Pipeline Integrity**: Ensures that files validated and hashed by `pre_staging.py` are exactly the files processed by subsequent stages, creating an unbroken chain of custody\n    26→\n    27→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories (installable vs stageable), and which pipeline components must be modified to use manifest-based retrieval.\n    28→\n    29→## Prerequisite Dependency\n    30→\n    31→**STATUS**: The Pre-Staging-Script feature is **COMPLETE**. This feature builds upon that foundation.\n    32→\n    33→The Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n    34→\n    35→- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n    36→- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n    37→- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n    38→\n    39→With `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n    40→\n    41→**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n    42→\n    43→## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n    44→\n    45→### Core Principle\n    46→\n    47→After `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n    48→\n    49→**Derivation Formula**:\n    50→- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n    51→- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n    52→\n    53→**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n    54→\n    55→### Why Two Categories\n    56→\n    57→**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n    58→\n    59→**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n    60→\n    61→**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n    62→\n    63→### File List Retrieval Pattern\n    64→\n    65→Each component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n    66→\n    67→**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n    68→```python\n    69→metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\n    70→files = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n    71→```\n    72→\n    73→**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n    74→```python\n    75→metadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    76→file_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\n    77→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n    78→```\n    79→\n    80→### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n    81→\n    82→Per project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n    83→\n    84→Local helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n    85→\n    86→### Manifest Trust Model\n    87→\n    88→**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n    89→\n    90→**Rationale**:\n    91→- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n    92→- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n    93→- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n    94→- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n    95→\n    96→## Pipeline Stages Affected\n    97→\n    98→### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n    99→\n   100→`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n   101→\n   102→### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   103→\n   104→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n   105→\n   106→**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n   107→\n   108→**Files Affected**:\n   109→- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   110→\n   111→### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   112→\n   113→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n   114→\n   115→**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json`.\n   116→\n   117→**Files Affected**:\n   118→- `dev/scripts/build_package.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   119→\n   120→### Stage 4: wsd.py Install/Update (Manifest Consumer)\n   121→\n   122→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` in multiple locations:\n   123→- `detect_collisions()`: Scans source directory for collision detection during install\n   124→- `install_files()`: Scans source directory for file installation\n   125→- `calculate_required_disk_space()`: Scans source directory for disk space calculation\n   126→- `categorize_update_files()`: Scans source directory for update file categorization\n   127→\n   128→**Required Change**: Use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` instead of scanning with `collect_wsd_files()` in all four functions.\n   129→\n   130→**Files Affected**:\n   131→- `source/wsd.py`: Update `detect_collisions()`, `install_files()`, `calculate_required_disk_space()`, `categorize_update_files()`\n   132→\n   133→### Out of Scope: diff_installation.py\n   134→\n   135→`diff_installation.py` is a development utility script for comparing WSD installations. While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration. This script is not part of the core distribution pipeline and does not affect end-user installations.\n   136→\n   137→## Error Handling\n   138→\n   139→### Error Categories\n   140→\n   141→#### 1. Missing Manifest Errors\n   142→\n   143→**Error**: `wsd.json` does not exist or cannot be read\n   144→\n   145→**Example Message**:\n   146→```\n   147→Error: Cannot read wsd.json at /path/to/source/wsd.json\n   148→This file must exist and contain file_hashes.\n   149→Run pre_staging.py first to generate the manifest.\n   150→```\n   151→\n   152→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to generate `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`.\n   153→\n   154→#### 2. Missing or Empty file_hashes Field\n   155→\n   156→**Error**: `wsd.json` exists but `file_hashes` field is missing or empty\n   157→\n   158→**Example Messages**:\n   159→```\n   160→Error: wsd.json does not contain file_hashes field\n   161→The manifest appears to be from an older version or was not properly generated.\n   162→Run pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n   163→```\n   164→\n   165→```\n   166→Error: wsd.json contains empty file_hashes\n   167→The WSD Runtime must contain at least one file.\n   168→Run pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n   169→```\n   170→\n   171→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to populate `file_hashes`.\n   172→\n   173→**Validation Requirement**: All pipeline stages that read the manifest MUST validate that `file_hashes` is both present AND non-empty. An empty `file_hashes` indicates a manifest that was not properly generated or a corrupt state—there is no valid \"empty WSD Runtime\" scenario.\n   174→\n   175→#### 3. Missing File During Copy\n   176→\n   177→**Error**: A file listed in `file_hashes` does not exist on disk\n   178→\n   179→**Example Message**:\n   180→```\n   181→Error: Cannot copy file: /path/to/source/.claude/agents/task-master.md\n   182→File is listed in wsd.json but does not exist.\n   183→This may indicate the manifest is out of sync with the filesystem.\n   184→Run pre_staging.py to resynchronize.\n   185→```\n   186→\n   187→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to rescan and update the manifest.\n   188→\n   189→#### 4. Missing Hash Entry During Update\n   190→\n   191→**Error**: During install or update, a file path has no corresponding entry in `file_hashes`\n   192→\n   193→**Example Message**:\n   194→```\n   195→Error: Missing hash for 'scripts/health_check.py' in wsd.json manifest.\n   196→The manifest may be out of sync with source files.\n   197→Regenerate wsd.json with pre_staging.py.\n   198→```\n   199→\n   200→**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to regenerate the manifest with current file hashes.\n   201→\n   202→### Error Recovery Principles\n   203→\n   204→**Guarantee**: If the manifest is missing or malformed, operations fail fast with clear instructions to run `pre_staging.py`.\n   205→\n   206→**Contract**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT attempt to regenerate the manifest themselves. The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n   207→\n   208→## Design Decisions\n   209→\n   210→### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n   211→\n   212→**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n   213→\n   214→1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n   215→2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n   216→3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n   217→4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n   218→\n   219→**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n   220→\n   221→1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n   222→2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n   223→3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n   224→4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n   225→\n   226→### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n   227→\n   228→Per Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n   229→\n   230→**Rationale**:\n   231→- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n   232→- No complex logic to encapsulate\n   233→- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n   234→- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n   235→\n   236→### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n   237→\n   238→`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n   239→\n   240→**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n   241→```python\n   242→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n   243→```\n   244→\n   245→This is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n   246→\n   247→## Testing Scenarios\n   248→\n   249→**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories. Example:\n   250→```python\n   251→# CORRECT:\n   252→sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"source\" / \"scripts\"))\n   253→\n   254→# INCORRECT:\n   255→sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"scripts\"))\n   256→```\n   257→\n   258→### Basic Manifest Reading Tests\n   259→\n   260→1. **Valid Manifest Reading**: Read file list from valid `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, verify list matches manifest keys\n   261→\n   262→2. **Stageable File List**: Get stageable files, verify `wsd.json` is included alongside `file_hashes.keys()`\n   263→\n   264→3. **Installable File List**: Get installable files, verify `wsd.json` is NOT included\n   265→\n   266→### Error Handling Tests\n   267→\n   268→1. **Missing wsd.json**: Attempt to read manifest from directory without `wsd.json`, verify clear error and instructions\n   269→\n   270→2. **Missing file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` without `file_hashes` field, verify error points to `pre_staging.py`\n   271→\n   272→3. **Empty file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` with empty `file_hashes`, verify error is raised (empty file_hashes is never valid)\n   273→\n   274→### Integration Tests\n   275→\n   276→1. **Full Pipeline Flow**: Run `pre_staging.py`, then `stage_release.py`, then `build_package.py`, verify all stages use manifest file list\n   277→\n   278→2. **Staged File Verification**: After staging, verify staged files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`\n   279→\n   280→3. **Install File Verification**: After install, verify installed files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` (without `wsd.json`)\n   281→\n   282→4. **Update File Verification**: Run update operation, verify file categorization uses manifest-based file list\n   283→\n   284→### Regression Tests\n   285→\n   286→1. **No collect_wsd_files Calls**: After implementation, grep codebase to verify `collect_wsd_files()` only called in `pre_staging.py`\n   287→\n   288→2. **Exclusion Consistency**: Verify files excluded by `pre_staging.py` (via `.wsdignore`, suspicious patterns) are consistently absent from all pipeline stages\n   289→\n   290→## Best Practices\n   291→\n   292→### For Pipeline Script Maintainers\n   293→\n   294→1. **Never Add New Scanning**: If you need a file list, read it from the manifest. Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n   295→\n   296→2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n   297→\n   298→3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n   299→\n   300→### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n   301→\n   302→1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n   303→\n   304→2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n   305→\n   306→3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n   307→\n   308→## Related Specifications\n   309→\n   310→- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n   311→- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n   312→- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n   313→- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n   314→- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n   315→- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n   316→\n   317→---\n   318→\n   319→*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling.

Missing `wsd_utils.py` analysis in scope section**\n\nThe spec mentions `collect_wsd_files()` will remain ONLY in `pre_staging.py`, but the function is defined in `source/scripts/wsd_utils.py`. The spec should explicitly clarify:\n- The function itself stays in `wsd_utils.py` (it's a utility)\n- Only the CALL SITES are being removed from the pipeline scripts\n- The import statement removal tasks (1.1.5, 2.1.4, 3.3) should remove the import, not the function definition\n\n**Recommendation**: Add clarifying text that `collect_wsd_files()` remains in `wsd_utils.py` but will only be imported/used by `pre_staging.py`.\n\n---\n\n**3. Task 3.1.4 validation timing concern**\n\nTask 3.1.4 says to add validation in `read_wsd_metadata()` that `file_hashes` is non-empty. However, `read_wsd_metadata()` is also called by `categorize_update_files()` which reads from the UPDATE source. \n\nLooking at the current code at line 3871 in `source/wsd.py`, `read_wsd_metadata()` is called in `detect_collisions()`. If we add non-empty validation there, it would affect all callers, which is correct.\n\n**Observation**: This is fine - just noting the validation will propagate to all call sites, which is the intended behavior.\n\n---\n\n**4. No task for removing `collect_wsd_files` from `wsd_utils.py` imports in `source/wsd.py`**\n\nLooking at `source/wsd.py` lines 52-59, it imports `collect_wsd_files` from `wsd_utils`. Task 3.3 says \"Remove unused `collect_wsd_files` import from `source/wsd.py`\" but the import line also includes other functions:\n\n```python\nfrom wsd_utils import (  # noqa: E402\n    WsdCollectionError,\n    _is_binary_file,\n    calculate_file_hash,\n    collect_wsd_files,\n    detect_package_manager,\n    detect_project_languages,\n)\n```\n\n**Recommendation**: Task 3.3 is accurate as written. The change will simply remove `collect_wsd_files,` from this import list. No issue here.\n\n---\n\n**5. Phase 5.3 integration verification needs clarification on scope**\n\nTask 5.3.1 says \"Run full pipeline in temp dirs: `pre_staging.py` -> `stage_release.py` -> `build_package.py`\". This is marked as integration verification, but:\n- There's no explicit test file for this (unlike the unit tests mentioned in earlier phases)\n- It's unclear if this is a manual verification or should be an automated test\n\n**Recommendation**: Clarify whether 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 are manual verification steps the developer performs, or if they should result in new integration tests being added.\n\n---\n\n**6. `WsdCollectionError` import may need to remain in `source/wsd.py`**\n\nLooking at `source/wsd.py` line 4381, `WsdCollectionError` is still caught in exception handling:\n\n```python\nexcept (FileNotFoundError, WsdCollectionError, OSError) as e:\n```\n\nAfter removing `collect_wsd_files()` calls, this exception won't be raised anymore. However, the import includes it. Should this import also be removed?\n\n**Recommendation**: Add a sub-task to 3.3: \"**3.3.1** - Also remove `WsdCollectionError` from import if no longer needed after `collect_wsd_files` removal\"\n\n---\n\n**7. The spec doesn't address `_is_binary_file` import in `source/wsd.py`**\n\nLooking at the imports, `_is_binary_file` is also imported. Looking through the code, I need to verify if it's used elsewhere.
