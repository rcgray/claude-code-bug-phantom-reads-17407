    23→### Mandatory Standards Files Read:
    24→1. docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md
    25→2. docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md
    26→3. docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md

    28→5. docs/read-only/standards/Process-Integrity-Standards.md
    29→
    30→### Critical Rules Emphasized:
    31→
    32→**Rule 5.1 - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (MOST VIOLATED)**
    33→- This app has NOT shipped yet
    34→- No migration solutions, legacy support, or backward compatibility
    35→- Violations result in IMMEDIATE REJECTION
    36→
    37→**Rule 3.4 - NO META-PROCESS REFERENCES IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS**
    38→- Source code, tests, scripts must NOT reference phase numbers, task IDs, ticket numbers
    39→- Only process documents (specs, tickets, Action Plans) should contain these
    40→
    41→**Rule 3.11 - WRITE-PROTECTED FILES**
    42→- If cannot write to docs/read-only/ or .claude/, copy to docs/workbench/ with exact same filename
    43→
    44→**Rule 6.1 - WSD DEVELOPMENT VS WSD RUNTIME**
    45→- All code changes target `source/` directory (the product)
    46→- Root `wsd.py` and `scripts/` are dogfood copies (read-only)
    47→- Tests import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root
    48→- Quality tools explicitly target `source/` and `tests/`
    49→
    50→**Rule 4.4 - cat >> EOF IS FORBIDDEN**
    51→- Use Edit tool for file modifications, never terminal commands
    52→
    53→**Proof of Work Requirements (Rule 3.12):**
    54→- Test-Guardian: Must show test summary line (e.g., "140 passed in 0.23s")
    55→- Health-Inspector: Must show complete HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY table
    56→- Reject approvals without proper evidence
    57→
    58→**QA Discovery Reporting (Rules 4.9, 3.15, 3.16):**
    59→- Report ALL issues to User, even if "not my workscope"
    60→- User has no visibility into tool outputs or Special Agent conversations
    61→- Information that dies with session is lost forever
    62→
    63→### Key Standards Summary:
    64→
    65→**Coding Standards:**
    66→- Fail at point of failure, don't create workarounds
    67→- Trust documented guarantees
    68→- Use comment blocks, check them after edits
    69→- 4 spaces for indentation
    70→
    71→**Python Standards:**
    72→- Use `uv` for dependency management
    73→- Type hints mandatory, lowercase type parameters (list[int] not List[int])
    74→- ALL functions must have explicit return type annotations
    75→- Google-style docstrings with Args, Returns, Raises sections
    76→
    77→**Test Environment Isolation:**
    78→- Tests must pass identically on any machine
    79→- Environment variables: use @patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)
    80→- File operations: always use tmp_path fixture
    81→- Network calls: mock in unit tests
    82→- Module-level derived constants: patch ALL constants in dependency chain
    83→
    84→**Specification Maintenance:**
    85→- Specs are sources of truth
    86→- Code changes require spec updates in same workscope
    87→- Specification drift = critical violation
    88→
    89→**Process Integrity:**
    90→- Automated tools must match direct tool execution
    91→- No silent error suppression
    92→- All exceptions require explicit User approval
    93→
    94→### Checkpoint Confirmations:
    95→1. ✅ Rule 5.1 violations result in immediate rejection of ALL work
    96→2. ✅ Must provide actual tool output evidence from Special Agents
    97→3. ✅ Understand WSD Development vs WSD Runtime distinction
    98→4. ✅ `[%]` tasks require full implementation responsibility
