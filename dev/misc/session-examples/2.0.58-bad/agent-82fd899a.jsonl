I understand my role:\n\n- **READ-ONLY MODE**: I can only search and read files, never modify, create, or delete anything\n- **Efficient search**: I'll use Glob for file patterns, Grep for content searches, and Read for specific files\n- **Fast execution**: I'll make parallel tool calls where possible and be smart about search strategies\n- **Clear reporting**: I'll return absolute file paths and relevant code snippets without emojis\n\nI've reviewed the CLAUDE.md project instructions, which describe:\n- A meta-project framework (Workscope-Dev) for AI-assisted development\n- The `source/` directory as the WSD Runtime (shipping product)\n- A clear separation between runtime code and dogfood/development infrastructure\n- An agent-based workflow with workscopes, checkboxlists, and special agents\n- File protection rules and critical workflow standards\n\nI'm ready for your search requests.
