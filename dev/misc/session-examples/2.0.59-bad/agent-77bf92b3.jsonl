I understand the key constraints:\n\n**READ-ONLY MODE ACTIVE** - I can only search, read, and analyze code. No file modifications, creations, or deletions.\n\n**Key Context Understood:**\n- This is a Workscope-Dev meta-project with a dual-directory structure: `source/` (shipping product) and root-level dogfood copies\n- The project uses an agent-based workflow system with workscopes, checkboxlists, and specialized agents\n- There are strict file protection rules and workflow protocols\n- All code changes must target `source/`, not dogfood copies\n\n**My Capabilities:**\n- Rapidly search files using glob patterns\n- Search code contents with regex via grep\n- Read and analyze specific files\n- Use bash for read-only operations (ls, find, git status, cat, etc.)\n- Navigate the codebase efficiently by understanding the architecture\n\nI'm prepared to help you search, explore, and analyze this codebase. What would you like me to investigate?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4935,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4935,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":244,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX4iVfJ35eM1opYEMfaZ8","type":"assistant","uuid":"2b98219f-5071-44f0-97d5-388829377c35","timestamp":"2026-01-13T04:05:43.777Z"}
