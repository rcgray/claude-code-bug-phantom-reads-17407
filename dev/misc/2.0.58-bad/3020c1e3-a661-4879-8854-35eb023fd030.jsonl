Most common usage is simply `/wsd:init` with no arguments.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n/wsd:init\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init Do all of Phase 5, but not Phase 6\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init --custom\n```\n\n---\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV wsd-init-project-introduction>\nWe are building an AI orchestration system for projects that tightly integrate AI-assisted development with Claude Code (and other platforms with similar feature support). The name of this project is Workscope-Dev (https://workscope.dev), often abbreviated \"WSD\". It is a collection of templates, agent definitions, rule systems, and developer scripts that make working with AI Assistants more efficient.\n\nOur goal is different than typical Python projects that aim to build a package. Instead, we are building an orchestration system, and our deliverable is a set of files that exist in the `source/` directory of this repository. We refer to the deliverable directory internally as the \"WSD Runtime\" and it is what will eventually ship to end-users. This repository around the WSD Runtime is referred to (internally) as the WSD Development project, and end-users will not have access to it. To further complicate things, the WSD Development project _uses_ WSD in its endeavors to create the WSD Runtime, so there are places where you will see duplicate files (e.g., `wsd.py` and `source/wsd.py`). Files inside the `source/` directory are the product we ship; files outside the `source/` directory are where we are using the product we ship (a WSD installation) to further develop the product (files in the `source/` directory).\n\nYou should read the following key project files before you begin work:\n- `docs/core/PRD.md` ( @docs/core/PRD.md )\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\nFirst Directive: Print a message acknowledging that you read the content in the `wsd-init-project-introduction` section immediately above and followed all directions therein.\n\n## Workscope System\n\nRun the `/wsd:boot` command to read the necessary files for understanding the Workscope-Dev Platform. When it is complete, return here and finish the remaining instructions.\n\n## Workscope ID Generation\n\nGenerate a unique Workscope ID for this session based on the current timestamp:\n\n1. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp\n2. Report your Workscope ID, which is derived from this timestamp according to the pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n\n**Remember this Workscope ID** as you will use it throughout your session for:\n- Work Journal naming\n- Workscope file naming (if fetching from Task-Master)\n- All agent communications\n\n## Work Journal\n\nYour next preparation task is to start a new \"Work Journal\" for YOUR fresh session with the Workscope ID:\n\n**CRITICAL - Work Journal in Archive Location:**\n\nRun the Work Journal initialization script, substituting your Workscope ID in the command below. Note that `[Workscope ID]` is strictly the `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` identifier, with no added prefix or suffix:\n\n(bash):\n   bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh \"[Workscope ID]\"\n\nThis script will create a new Work Journal directly in the archive location at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`. Verify that this file exists and was properly formed (with the correct filename).\n\nThis file is now YOUR \"Work Journal,\" and you will be continually adding to it over the course of YOUR session as you proceed through your workscope. Be sure to update your Work Journal after each step so this real time monitoring can take place.\n\n**CRITICAL**: `cat >> file << EOF` IS FORBIDDEN. It is an anti-pattern that will likely result in full rejection of your contributions. Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`) to write to files. Use your standard tools (e.g., Read, Edit, etc.) to interact with files throughout your session. You will be reminded of this as **Rule 4.4** in the Agent Rules.\n\n## Task-Master Assignment (Conditional)\n\n**IF `$1` is `--custom`:**\n- Run the `/wsd:onboard` command and return to this command\n- Skip the rest of this section and continue to \"## Completion Behavior\"\n- You will receive your workscope directly from the User after this command completes\n\n**OTHERWISE (including if `$1` is empty):**\n- Consult @agent-task-master to fetch your workscope assignment\n- Provide the Task-Master with your Workscope ID that you generated earlier\n- Workscope directive (forward to Task-Master if provided): $1\n\nThe Task-Master has complete instructions in its definition and will:\n  - Create a workscope file at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`\n  - Mark the selected tasks with `[*]` in the relevant checkboxlists\n  - Return the workscope file path to you\n\nRead the workscope file. **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Your workscope will assign SPECIFIC TASK NUMBERS (e.g., \"3.5, 3.6, 3.7\") for execution. While you should understand the entire phase as context for how your tasks fit into the larger picture, you are responsible for EXECUTING only your assigned task numbers.\n\nMANDATORY: After reading your workscope file, literally copy the ENTIRE, VERBATIM content of the workscope document into the Work Journal. Do this before moving on to the next step. The User will read your Work Journal, and if the User does not see the exact, verbatim text of your workscope file present in the Work Journal after it was assigned to you by the Task-Master agent, your entire session will be immediately terminated.\n\n### Phase Inventory Validation\n\nBefore accepting, check the Phase Inventory for this error: \"CLEAR (all [%])\" or any \"CLEAR\" with a qualifier. Phases with `[%]` items are NOT CLEAR.\n\nIf you detect this error: Reject the workscope. Tell Task-Master to delete the invalid workscope file and redo the assignment correctly. This is the one exception to workscope immutability—an invalid workscope must be replaced.\n\n## Completion Behavior\n\nUpon completing the initialization steps above, return to the User with a clear message at the END of your reply.\n\nMANDATORY: Put the following text at the END of your reply, verbatim:\n**\"WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: propose changes, describe the workscope, or `/wsd:prepare`. To abandon completely, `/wsd:abort`.\"**\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe command should handle these error conditions:\n\n1. **Agent communication failures**: Retry agent communications if they fail\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --custom"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"b97ca205-ec35-4282-aefa-048528da7a28","timestamp":"2026-01-13T09:50:50.356Z"}

Since you were initialized with the `--custom` flag, you will receive your workscope directly from the User after this onboarding is complete. My job is to ensure you understand the rules and standards BEFORE you begin any work, so that your contributions are not rejected by our Special Agents.\n\n## MANDATORY READING - YOU MUST READ THESE FILES BEFORE BEGINNING WORK\n\nYou have been initialized in a system with strict rules and multiple Special Agents who have VETO POWER. If you violate rules or standards, your ENTIRE workscope will be REJECTED, and all your effort will be wasted.\n\n### PHASE 1: Core System Understanding (MUST READ ALL)\n\nRead these files IN THEIR ENTIRETY to understand the fundamental systems:\n\n1. **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`**\n   - Contains INVIOLABLE LAWS that govern ALL agent behavior\n   - ANY violation results in COMPLETE REJECTION of your work\n   - Pay special attention to Rules 3.4 (no meta-commentary in product artifacts), 5.1 (no backward compatibility), and 3.11 (workbench editing for protected files)\n\n2. **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`**\n   - Project-specific design philosophies that complement Agent-Rules.md\n   - Covers critical distinctions like WSD Runtime vs WSD Development\n   - Explains principles for configuration, dependencies, and code organization\n\n3. **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`**\n   - Universal coding standards that apply to ALL code you write\n   - Required reading regardless of language\n\n### PHASE 2: Language-Specific Standards (READ IF APPLICABLE)\n\n**If your workscope involves Python code:**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`** (if writing tests)\n\n**If your workscope involves TypeScript/JavaScript code:**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Standards.md`**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`** (if writing tests)\n\n### PHASE 3: Additional Standards (READ IF APPLICABLE)\n\n**If your workscope involves configuration or environment variables:**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Environment-and-Config-Variable-Standards.md`**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Testing-Configuration-Variables-Standards.md`** (Python tests)\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/TypeScript-Testing-Configuration-Variables-Standards.md`** (TypeScript tests)\n\n**If your workscope involves updating specifications:**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`**\n\n**If your workscope involves data structures:**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Data-Structure-Documentation-Standards.md`**\n\n**If you need to add tool exceptions (# noqa, etc.):**\n- **`/Users/gray/Projects/claude-bug/docs/read-only/standards/Process-Integrity-Standards.md`**\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL WARNINGS - THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON VIOLATIONS\n\n### WARNING 1: Rule 5.1 - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (MOST VIOLATED RULE)\n\nThis project HAS NOT SHIPPED. When you make changes:\n- DO NOT include migration-based solutions\n- DO NOT be concerned with maintaining \"backward compatibility\" or \"legacy support\"\n- DO NOT write code that references old designs\n- DO NOT add comments acknowledging previous implementations\n\n**This is the MOST FREQUENTLY violated rule.** The Rule-Enforcer will REJECT your entire submission immediately if you violate this.\n\n### WARNING 2: Rule 3.4 - NO META-COMMENTARY IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS\n\n**Product artifacts** (source code, tests, scripts, configuration files) must NEVER contain:\n- Phase numbers (e.g., \"# Extracted from cli.py during Phase 2 refactoring\")\n- Task references (e.g., \"# Logs warnings for malformed tags (task 2.5.4)\")\n- Ticket numbers (e.g., \"// Fixed null pointer (see ticket #47)\")\n- Any reference to the development process\n\n**Process documents** (Feature Specs, tickets, Action Plans, workbench files) SHOULD contain these elements - that's their purpose.\n\nThis rule is violated so frequently that we have a special tool to audit the code. Do not violate this rule.\n\n### WARNING 3: Rule 3.11 - BLOCKED WRITE ACCESS SOLUTION\n\nIf you try to edit a file in `docs/read-only/` or `.claude/` and get write-access errors:\n- COPY the file to `docs/workbench/` keeping the EXACT same filename\n- Make your edits to the workbench copy\n- Do NOT add annotations or suffixes\n- Inform the User that you've created an edited version for their review\n\nDo not come to me asking what to do. The solution is in the rules.\n\n### WARNING 4: WSD Runtime vs WSD Development (Rule 6.1)\n\n**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**\n- **WSD Runtime** = `source/` directory = THE SHIPPING PRODUCT\n- **WSD Development** = This repository = The meta-project that builds WSD Runtime\n- **Dogfood files** = Root-level `wsd.py` and `scripts/` = READ-ONLY synchronized copies\n\n**ALL code changes must target `source/`, NEVER the dogfood copies at the root.**\n\nWhen you reason about code in `source/`, think about where it will exist AFTER DEPLOYMENT to an end-user project, not where it currently sits in the development repository.\n\n### WARNING 5: `[%]` Tasks - YOU ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE\n\nIf your workscope contains tasks marked `[%]`:\n- Treat `[%]` EXACTLY as you would treat `[ ]`\n- You are FULLY RESPONSIBLE for complete, correct implementation\n- Some or all work may exist, but DO NOT assume it is correct or complete\n- Work through the task as if implementing from scratch, comparing against what exists\n- Find the \"delta\" between current implementation and specification, then implement it\n- The `[%]` is a WARNING: \"Don't get lazy - verify everything against the spec\"\n\n**Common failure mode:** Agent sees existing code, assumes it's done, skips verification, misses critical gaps.\n\n---\n\n## KEY EXPECTATIONS FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR\n\n### 1. You Must Follow the Standard User Agent Workflow\n\nAfter receiving your workscope from the User, you will:\n\n**Pre-Execution Phase:**\n- Consult Context-Librarian for relevant documentation\n- Consult Codebase-Surveyor for relevant code files\n- Synthesize Situational Awareness (understand the broader work arc)\n- HALT and report understanding to User for approval\n\n**Execution Phase:**\n- Execute the assigned workscope\n\n**Quality Assurance Phase:**\n- Check with Documentation-Steward (specification compliance)\n- Check with Rule-Enforcer (rules and standards compliance)\n- Check with Test-Guardian (test coverage, no regressions)\n- Check with Health-Inspector (code quality, project health)\n\n**Termination Phase:**\n- HALT: \"Execution complete. Run /wsd:close to accept or /wsd:abort to reject\"\n- Wait for User to run `/wsd:close` or `/wsd:abort`\n\n### 2. You Must Verify Special Agent \"Proof of Work\"\n\nWhen Special Agents complete their reviews, they MUST provide evidence they actually performed their duties:\n\n- **Test-Guardian:** MUST include test summary output (e.g., \"140 passed in 0.23s\")\n- **Health-Inspector:** MUST include the complete HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY table\n\nIf they do NOT provide this evidence, REJECT their approval and demand they re-run with proper proof.\n\n### 3. You Must Respect Authority Boundaries\n\n- Only Task-Master can update checkboxlists and close tickets\n- Only Context-Librarian can archive workbench documents (suggestions welcome)\n- Only User can authorize skipping tasks `[-]` or marking tasks for validation `[%]`\n- Documentation-Steward and Rule-Enforcer have VETO POWER\n\n### 4. You Must Report ALL Discoveries to the User\n\nRule 3.16: You are the User's eyes and ears. The User has NO visibility into your conversations with Special Agents or tool outputs. ALL discoveries—issues, warnings, anomalies, concerns raised by ANY agent—must be reported to the User.\n\n\"Not my workscope\" determines what you must FIX, not what you must REPORT.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE\n\n### This Is a Python Project with JavaScript Tests\n\n- Main product: Python code in `source/`\n- Test suite: `tests/` directory using pytest\n- JavaScript tests: Test the WSD Runtime tools that support TypeScript/JavaScript projects\n- Quality commands: `./wsd.py test`, `./wsd.py lint`, `./wsd.py health`\n\n### File Locations Matter\n\n- `source/` = WSD Runtime (the product) - EDIT HERE\n- `scripts/` (root) = Dogfood copies - DO NOT EDIT\n- `dev/scripts/` = WSD Development-only scripts - CAN EDIT\n- `docs/workbench/` = Working memory for current tasks\n- `docs/read-only/` = Protected documentation - COPY TO WORKBENCH TO EDIT\n\n### Critical Commands\n\n```bash\n./wsd.py health:clean    # Run before commits - deterministic validation\n./wsd.py test            # Run test suite\n./wsd.py lint            # Check code quality\n```\n\n---\n\n## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou have now received your onboarding. The User will provide you with your specific workscope assignment.\n\n**After receiving your workscope, you MUST:**\n\n1. HALT and check in with the User before beginning Pre-Execution Phase\n2. Follow the standard User Agent workflow outlined above\n3. Read ALL files specified in Phase 1 (Agent-Rules.md, Design-Decisions.md, Coding-Standards.md)\n4. Read language-specific standards if applicable to your workscope\n5. Consult Context-Librarian and Codebase-Surveyor before execution\n6. Execute your workscope with full compliance to all rules and standards\n7. Verify Special Agent proof of work during QA phase\n8. Report ALL discoveries to the User, even if \"not your workscope\"\n9. HALT after QA and wait for `/wsd:close` or `/wsd:abort`\n\n**Remember:** Breaking ANY rule in Agent-Rules.md means ALL your work is REJECTED. Read the rules carefully. Understand the standards thoroughly. Ask questions if anything is unclear.\n\nYou are now prepared to receive your workscope assignment from the User."}]}]},"uuid":"74dbdcae-4742-4225-a685-1a025df6b6b2","timestamp":"2026-01-13T09:52:53.170Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I am a User Agent with Workscope ID: 20260113-015117\n\nI am being initialized with the `--custom` flag, meaning I will receive my workscope directly from the User after initialization completes.

The solution is in the rules.\n\n### WARNING 4: WSD Runtime vs WSD Development (Rule 6.1)\n\n**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**\n- **WSD Runtime** = `source/` directory = THE SHIPPING PRODUCT\n- **WSD Development** = This repository = The meta-project that builds WSD Runtime\n- **Dogfood files** = Root-level `wsd.py` and `scripts/` = READ-ONLY synchronized copies\n\n**ALL code changes must target `source/`, NEVER the dogfood copies at the root.**\n\nWhen you reason about code in `source/`, think about where it will exist AFTER DEPLOYMENT to an end-user project, not where it currently sits in the development repository.\n\n### WARNING 5: `[%]` Tasks - YOU ARE FULLY RESPONSIBLE\n\nIf your workscope contains tasks marked `[%]`:\n- Treat `[%]` EXACTLY as you would treat `[ ]`\n- You are FULLY RESPONSIBLE for complete, correct implementation\n- Some or all work may exist, but DO NOT assume it is correct or complete\n- Work through the task as if implementing from scratch, comparing against what exists\n- Find the \"delta\" between current implementation and specification, then implement it\n- The `[%]` is a WARNING: \"Don't get lazy - verify everything against the spec\"\n\n**Common failure mode:** Agent sees existing code, assumes it's done, skips verification, misses critical gaps.\n\n---\n\n## KEY EXPECTATIONS FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR\n\n### 1. You Must Follow the Standard User Agent Workflow\n\nAfter receiving your workscope from the User, you will:\n\n**Pre-Execution Phase:**\n- Consult Context-Librarian for relevant documentation\n- Consult Codebase-Surveyor for relevant code files\n- Synthesize Situational Awareness (understand the broader work arc)\n- HALT and report understanding to User for approval\n\n**Execution Phase:**\n- Execute the assigned workscope\n\n**Quality Assurance Phase:**\n- Check with Documentation-Steward (specification compliance)\n- Check with Rule-Enforcer (rules and standards compliance)\n- Check with Test-Guardian (test coverage, no regressions)\n- Check with Health-Inspector (code quality, project health)\n\n**Termination Phase:**\n- HALT: \"Execution complete. Run /wsd:close to accept or /wsd:abort to reject\"\n- Wait for User to run `/wsd:close` or `/wsd:abort`\n\n### 2. You Must Verify Special Agent \"Proof of Work\"\n\nWhen Special Agents complete their reviews, they MUST provide evidence they actually performed their duties:\n\n- **Test-Guardian:** MUST include test summary output (e.g., \"140 passed in 0.23s\")\n- **Health-Inspector:** MUST include the complete HEALTH CHECK SUMMARY table\n\nIf they do NOT provide this evidence, REJECT their approval and demand they re-run with proper proof.\n\n### 3. You Must Respect Authority Boundaries\n\n- Only Task-Master can update checkboxlists and close tickets\n- Only Context-Librarian can archive workbench documents (suggestions welcome)\n- Only User can authorize skipping tasks `[-]` or marking tasks for validation `[%]`\n- Documentation-Steward and Rule-Enforcer have VETO POWER\n\n### 4. You Must Report ALL Discoveries to the User\n\nRule 3.16: You are the User's eyes and ears. The User has NO visibility into your conversations with Special Agents or tool outputs. ALL discoveries—issues, warnings, anomalies, concerns raised by ANY agent—must be reported to the User.\n\n\"Not my workscope\" determines what you must FIX, not what you must REPORT.\n\n---\n\n## PROJECT-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE\n\n### This Is a Python Project with JavaScript Tests\n\n- Main product: Python code in `source/`\n- Test suite: `tests/` directory using pytest\n- JavaScript tests: Test the WSD Runtime tools that support TypeScript/JavaScript projects\n- Quality commands: `./wsd.py test`, `./wsd.py lint`, `./wsd.py health`\n\n### File Locations Matter\n\n- `source/` = WSD Runtime (the product) - EDIT HERE\n- `scripts/` (root) = Dogfood copies - DO NOT EDIT\n- `dev/scripts/` = WSD Development-only scripts - CAN EDIT\n- `docs/workbench/` = Working memory for current tasks\n- `docs/read-only/` = Protected documentation - COPY TO WORKBENCH TO EDIT\n\n### Critical Commands\n\n```bash\n./wsd.py health:clean    # Run before commits - deterministic validation\n./wsd.py test            # Run test suite\n./wsd.py lint            # Check code quality\n```\n\n---\n\n## FINAL INSTRUCTIONS\n\nYou have now received your onboarding. The User will provide you with your specific workscope assignment.\n\n**After receiving your workscope, you MUST:**\n\n1. HALT and check in with the User before beginning Pre-Execution Phase\n2. Follow the standard User Agent workflow outlined above\n3. Read ALL files specified in Phase 1 (Agent-Rules.md, Design-Decisions.md, Coding-Standards.md)\n4. Read language-specific standards if applicable to your workscope\n5. Consult Context-Librarian and Codebase-Surveyor before execution\n6. Execute your workscope with full compliance to all rules and standards\n7. Verify Special Agent proof of work during QA phase\n8. Report ALL discoveries to the User, even if \"not your workscope\"\n9. HALT after QA and wait for `/wsd:close` or `/wsd:abort`\n\n**Remember:** Breaking ANY rule in Agent-Rules.md means ALL your work is REJECTED. Read the rules carefully. Understand the standards thoroughly. Ask questions if anything is unclear.\n\nYou are now prepared to receive your workscope assignment from the User."}],"totalDurationMs":77138,"totalTokens":54609,"totalToolUseCount":7,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":32285,"cache_read_input_tokens":19575,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":32285,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2743,"service_tier":"standard"}}}

Fail at the point of failure immediately instead of creating workarounds. If a particular state or combination of variables could never occur, throw an exception or console log an error or whatever is appropriate.\n     4→- Remember Chesterton's Fence: don't remove something you perceive as useless until you fully understand why it was added in the first place. Not everything is an accident, and your predecessors may have endured a lot to discover the present solution.\n     5→- Handle external uncertainties gracefully (i.e., an API call fails, a file is not found, etc.), but be strict about internal logic. Don't create workarounds for failures in states or variables that we control internally.\n     6→- Simplify and favor Sources of Truth. If a particular state of the program requires that a particular component is active, and it's possible to check that the component is active, do not have a secondary variable tracking that it is active. If we ever have a state variable that can be determined more accurately by a reliable Source of Truth, omit it.\n     7→- When it comes to conflicting Sources of Truth, they must be resolved immediately following this order of descending priority: Documentation (Specification), Test, Code. Do not \"rewrite\" failing code merely to appease tests, and do not write test plans to accommodate discrepancies you find in code.

If a particular state or combination of variables could never occur, throw an exception or console log an error or whatever is appropriate.\n- Remember Chesterton's Fence: don't remove something you perceive as useless until you fully understand why it was added in the first place. Not everything is an accident, and your predecessors may have endured a lot to discover the present solution.\n- Handle external uncertainties gracefully (i.e., an API call fails, a file is not found, etc.), but be strict about internal logic. Don't create workarounds for failures in states or variables that we control internally.\n- Simplify and favor Sources of Truth. If a particular state of the program requires that a particular component is active, and it's possible to check that the component is active, do not have a secondary variable tracking that it is active. If we ever have a state variable that can be determined more accurately by a reliable Source of Truth, omit it.\n- When it comes to conflicting Sources of Truth, they must be resolved immediately following this order of descending priority: Documentation (Specification), Test, Code.

This feature builds upon that foundation.\n    32→\n    33→The Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n    34→\n    35→- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n    36→- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n    37→- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n    38→\n    39→With `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n    40→\n    41→**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n    42→\n    43→## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n    44→\n    45→### Core Principle\n    46→\n    47→After `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n    48→\n    49→**Derivation Formula**:\n    50→- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n    51→- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n    52→\n    53→**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n    54→\n    55→### Why Two Categories\n    56→\n    57→**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n    58→\n    59→**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n    60→\n    61→**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n    62→\n    63→### File List Retrieval Pattern\n    64→\n    65→Each component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n    66→\n    67→**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n    68→```python\n    69→metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\n    70→files = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n    71→```\n    72→\n    73→**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n    74→```python\n    75→metadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    76→file_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\n    77→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n    78→```\n    79→\n    80→### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n    81→\n    82→Per project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n    83→\n    84→Local helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n    85→\n    86→### Manifest Trust Model\n    87→\n    88→**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n    89→\n    90→**Rationale**:\n    91→- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n    92→- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n    93→- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n    94→- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n    95→\n    96→## Pipeline Stages Affected\n    97→\n    98→### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n    99→\n   100→`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n   101→\n   102→### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   103→\n   104→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n   105→\n   106→**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n   107→\n   108→**Files Affected**:\n   109→- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n   110→\n   111→### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n   112→\n   113→**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n   114→\n   115→**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning.

While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration.

The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n   207→\n   208→## Design Decisions\n   209→\n   210→### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n   211→\n   212→**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n   213→\n   214→1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n   215→2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n   216→3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n   217→4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n   218→\n   219→**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n   220→\n   221→1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n   222→2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n   223→3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n   224→4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n   225→\n   226→### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n   227→\n   228→Per Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n   229→\n   230→**Rationale**:\n   231→- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n   232→- No complex logic to encapsulate\n   233→- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n   234→- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n   235→\n   236→### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n   237→\n   238→`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n   239→\n   240→**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n   241→```python\n   242→files = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n   243→```\n   244→\n   245→This is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n   246→\n   247→## Testing Scenarios\n   248→\n   249→**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories. Example:\n   250→```python\n   251→# CORRECT:\n   252→sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"source\" / \"scripts\"))\n   253→\n   254→# INCORRECT:\n   255→sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"scripts\"))\n   256→```\n   257→\n   258→### Basic Manifest Reading Tests\n   259→\n   260→1. **Valid Manifest Reading**: Read file list from valid `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, verify list matches manifest keys\n   261→\n   262→2. **Stageable File List**: Get stageable files, verify `wsd.json` is included alongside `file_hashes.keys()`\n   263→\n   264→3. **Installable File List**: Get installable files, verify `wsd.json` is NOT included\n   265→\n   266→### Error Handling Tests\n   267→\n   268→1. **Missing wsd.json**: Attempt to read manifest from directory without `wsd.json`, verify clear error and instructions\n   269→\n   270→2. **Missing file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` without `file_hashes` field, verify error points to `pre_staging.py`\n   271→\n   272→3. **Empty file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` with empty `file_hashes`, verify error is raised (empty file_hashes is never valid)\n   273→\n   274→### Integration Tests\n   275→\n   276→1. **Full Pipeline Flow**: Run `pre_staging.py`, then `stage_release.py`, then `build_package.py`, verify all stages use manifest file list\n   277→\n   278→2. **Staged File Verification**: After staging, verify staged files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`\n   279→\n   280→3. **Install File Verification**: After install, verify installed files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` (without `wsd.json`)\n   281→\n   282→4. **Update File Verification**: Run update operation, verify file categorization uses manifest-based file list\n   283→\n   284→### Regression Tests\n   285→\n   286→1. **No collect_wsd_files Calls**: After implementation, grep codebase to verify `collect_wsd_files()` only called in `pre_staging.py`\n   287→\n   288→2. **Exclusion Consistency**: Verify files excluded by `pre_staging.py` (via `.wsdignore`, suspicious patterns) are consistently absent from all pipeline stages\n   289→\n   290→## Best Practices\n   291→\n   292→### For Pipeline Script Maintainers\n   293→\n   294→1. **Never Add New Scanning**: If you need a file list, read it from the manifest. Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n   295→\n   296→2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n   297→\n   298→3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n   299→\n   300→### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n   301→\n   302→1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n   303→\n   304→2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n   305→\n   306→3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n   307→\n   308→## Related Specifications\n   309→\n   310→- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n   311→- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n   312→- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n   313→- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n   314→- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n   315→- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n   316→\n   317→---\n   318→\n   319→*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling.

After the Pre-Staging-Script feature populates `source/wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, all subsequent pipeline stages read their file lists from the manifest instead of re-scanning the filesystem using `collect_wsd_files()`.\n\nThis specification defines the manifest-based file list retrieval pattern, the pipeline stages that must adopt it, the distinction between installable and stageable file lists, and the migration path from empirical scanning to manifest-driven operations.\n\nFor broader architectural context on the WSD distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Manifest-Driven Pipeline serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Single Source of Truth**: Establishes `file_hashes.keys()` from `wsd.json` as the authoritative list of WSD Runtime files, eliminating redundant scanning logic across pipeline stages\n\n2. **Consistency Guarantee**: Ensures all pipeline stages operate on the same file list, preventing subtle bugs from differing exclusion rule implementations or race conditions between stages\n\n3. **Simplification**: Removes duplicated `collect_wsd_files()` calls from multiple scripts, reducing code complexity and maintenance burden\n\n4. **Pipeline Integrity**: Ensures that files validated and hashed by `pre_staging.py` are exactly the files processed by subsequent stages, creating an unbroken chain of custody\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories (installable vs stageable), and which pipeline components must be modified to use manifest-based retrieval.\n\n## Prerequisite Dependency\n\n**STATUS**: The Pre-Staging-Script feature is **COMPLETE**. This feature builds upon that foundation.\n\nThe Pre-Staging-Script feature (see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**) established:\n\n- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` scans `source/` and populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`\n- Hash generation was removed from `stage_release.py`\n- `stage_release.py` now copies `wsd.json` as a regular file (no modifications)\n\nWith `file_hashes` populated in `wsd.json`, all downstream pipeline stages can now read file lists and hashes from the manifest instead of re-scanning or recomputing.\n\n**Key Principle**: After `pre_staging.py` runs, **no other part of the pipeline should ever recompute source file hashes**. The manifest is the single source of truth for both the file list AND the pre-computed hashes.\n\n## Manifest-Based File List Derivation\n\n### Core Principle\n\nAfter `pre_staging.py` runs, `source/wsd.json` contains a `file_hashes` object mapping relative file paths to their SHA-256 hashes. The keys of this object constitute the canonical list of files in the WSD Runtime (excluding `installation_only` files).\n\n**Derivation Formula**:\n- **Installable files** = `file_hashes.keys()`\n- **Stageable files** = `file_hashes.keys()` + `[\"wsd.json\"]`\n\n**Note on `.wsdkeep` Files**: The `file_hashes` object does NOT include `.wsdkeep` files because directory requirements are declared via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`. The `.wsdkeep` files exist in `source/` as git placeholders, but during pre-staging they are scanned to populate `required_directories` and then excluded from hash generation. Install and update operations create `.wsdkeep` files locally based on directory state, not from the manifest file list. See **Template-System.md** for details on `.wsdkeep` handling.\n\n### Why Two Categories\n\n**Installable Files**: Files that get copied to end-user projects during `wsd.py install` and `wsd.py update`. This excludes `wsd.json` because it contains installation metadata that stays in the WSD Runtime source, not in client projects.\n\n**Stageable Files**: Files that get copied during staging and build operations. This includes `wsd.json` because it must be present in the staged output and the built package, even though it is not in `file_hashes` (it is listed in `installation_only`).\n\n**Terminology Note**: The `installation_only` array name can be confusing. It means files that exist \"only in the installation package\" (i.e., the WSD Runtime distribution) but are NOT copied to target projects. Alternatively, think of it as files included \"only for facilitating installation\" (like `wsd.json` which contains metadata needed by `wsd.py install` but isn't part of the actual WSD Runtime content delivered to users). Files in `installation_only` are explicitly excluded from `file_hashes`.\n\n### File List Retrieval Pattern\n\nEach component that needs a file list follows this pattern:\n\n**For Install/Update Operations** (installable files only):\n```python\nmetadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\nfiles = list(metadata.file_hashes.keys())\n```\n\n**For Staging/Build Operations** (include wsd.json):\n```python\nmetadata = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\nfile_hashes = metadata.get(\"file_hashes\", {})\nfiles = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n```\n\n### Design Constraint: No Shared Utility Functions\n\nPer project design principles (YAGNI), do NOT create shared utility functions in `wsd_utils.py` like `get_installable_files()` or `get_manifest_file_list()`. Each component should read `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly.\n\nLocal helper functions within individual scripts (like `get_stageable_files()` shown in the implementation patterns above) are acceptable for code organization, but avoid creating shared abstractions that all scripts import. The operation is simple enough that each script can implement it directly.\n\n### Manifest Trust Model\n\n**Constraint**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT validate that files listed in the manifest actually exist. If a file is missing, the copy operation will fail naturally with a clear error. The manifest is trusted after `pre_staging.py` validates it.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- `pre_staging.py` already validates file existence during hash generation\n- Adding redundant validation at each stage wastes cycles and duplicates logic\n- Natural copy failures provide clear, actionable error messages\n- The pipeline is designed to run in sequence; validation happens once at the source\n\n## Pipeline Stages Affected\n\n### Stage 1: pre_staging.py (No Changes)\n\n`pre_staging.py` is the ONLY script that scans for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. It populates `file_hashes` in `source/wsd.json`. This script is unaffected by this feature as it is the source of truth generator, not a consumer.\n\n### Stage 2: stage_release.py (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `source/` for files to stage.\n\n**Required Change**: Read file list from `source/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json` (since it's in `installation_only` and not in `file_hashes`).\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n\n### Stage 3: build_package.py (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` to scan `staging/` for files to package.\n\n**Required Change**: Read file list from `staging/wsd.json` manifest instead of scanning. Use `file_hashes.keys()` plus explicitly adding `wsd.json`.\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `dev/scripts/build_package.py`: Remove `collect_wsd_files()` call, add manifest reading\n\n### Stage 4: wsd.py Install/Update (Manifest Consumer)\n\n**Current Behavior**: Uses `collect_wsd_files()` in multiple locations:\n- `detect_collisions()`: Scans source directory for collision detection during install\n- `install_files()`: Scans source directory for file installation\n- `calculate_required_disk_space()`: Scans source directory for disk space calculation\n- `categorize_update_files()`: Scans source directory for update file categorization\n\n**Required Change**: Use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` instead of scanning with `collect_wsd_files()` in all four functions.\n\n**Files Affected**:\n- `source/wsd.py`: Update `detect_collisions()`, `install_files()`, `calculate_required_disk_space()`, `categorize_update_files()`\n\n### Out of Scope: diff_installation.py\n\n`diff_installation.py` is a development utility script for comparing WSD installations. While it currently uses `collect_wsd_files()`, updating it to use manifest-based file lists is deferred as a future consideration. This script is not part of the core distribution pipeline and does not affect end-user installations.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Missing Manifest Errors\n\n**Error**: `wsd.json` does not exist or cannot be read\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Cannot read wsd.json at /path/to/source/wsd.json\nThis file must exist and contain file_hashes.\nRun pre_staging.py first to generate the manifest.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to generate `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`.\n\n#### 2. Missing or Empty file_hashes Field\n\n**Error**: `wsd.json` exists but `file_hashes` field is missing or empty\n\n**Example Messages**:\n```\nError: wsd.json does not contain file_hashes field\nThe manifest appears to be from an older version or was not properly generated.\nRun pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n```\n\n```\nError: wsd.json contains empty file_hashes\nThe WSD Runtime must contain at least one file.\nRun pre_staging.py to regenerate the manifest.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to populate `file_hashes`.\n\n**Validation Requirement**: All pipeline stages that read the manifest MUST validate that `file_hashes` is both present AND non-empty. An empty `file_hashes` indicates a manifest that was not properly generated or a corrupt state—there is no valid \"empty WSD Runtime\" scenario.\n\n#### 3. Missing File During Copy\n\n**Error**: A file listed in `file_hashes` does not exist on disk\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Cannot copy file: /path/to/source/.claude/agents/task-master.md\nFile is listed in wsd.json but does not exist.\nThis may indicate the manifest is out of sync with the filesystem.\nRun pre_staging.py to resynchronize.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to rescan and update the manifest.\n\n#### 4. Missing Hash Entry During Update\n\n**Error**: During install or update, a file path has no corresponding entry in `file_hashes`\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nError: Missing hash for 'scripts/health_check.py' in wsd.json manifest.\nThe manifest may be out of sync with source files.\nRegenerate wsd.json with pre_staging.py.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Run `pre_staging.py` to regenerate the manifest with current file hashes.\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: If the manifest is missing or malformed, operations fail fast with clear instructions to run `pre_staging.py`.\n\n**Contract**: Pipeline stages MUST NOT attempt to regenerate the manifest themselves. The authoritative manifest generation is the sole responsibility of `pre_staging.py`.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Manifest-Based Instead of Scanning\n\n**Problem**: The pre-manifest approach had each pipeline stage independently scan for files using `collect_wsd_files()`. This created several issues:\n\n1. **Redundant Logic**: The same scanning and exclusion logic was executed 5+ times across the pipeline\n2. **Inconsistency Risk**: Each stage could potentially implement exclusion rules differently\n3. **Maintenance Burden**: Changes to file selection logic required updates in multiple places\n4. **No Validation Chain**: Files could be added/removed between stages without detection\n\n**Solution**: Establish a single scanning point (`pre_staging.py`) that generates the authoritative file list. All subsequent stages read from this list, creating:\n\n1. **Single Source**: One scan, one list, consistent everywhere\n2. **Guaranteed Consistency**: All stages see the same files\n3. **Simplified Maintenance**: File selection logic exists in one place\n4. **Validation Chain**: Hashes generated at scan time enable integrity checking\n\n### Why Not Create a Wrapper Function\n\nPer Design Decisions document (YAGNI principle), we use `metadata.file_hashes.keys()` directly rather than creating a utility function like `get_manifest_file_list()`.\n\n**Rationale**:\n- The operation is simple and self-documenting\n- No complex logic to encapsulate\n- Adding abstraction for two-line operations adds unnecessary indirection\n- If future needs require a wrapper, it can be added then\n\n### Why wsd.json Is Explicitly Added\n\n`wsd.json` is listed in `installation_only` (meaning it should not be copied to client projects), so it is not in `file_hashes`. However, for staging and build operations, we need `wsd.json` to be included in the output.\n\n**Solution**: Explicitly add `wsd.json` to the file list for staging/build operations:\n```python\nfiles = list(file_hashes.keys()) + [\"wsd.json\"]\n```\n\nThis is cleaner than special-casing `installation_only` handling and makes the intent explicit.\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Per Rule 6.1.2, all tests must import from `source/` or `source/scripts/`, never from root-level dogfood directories. Example:\n```python\n# CORRECT:\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"source\" / \"scripts\"))\n\n# INCORRECT:\nsys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"scripts\"))\n```\n\n### Basic Manifest Reading Tests\n\n1. **Valid Manifest Reading**: Read file list from valid `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`, verify list matches manifest keys\n\n2. **Stageable File List**: Get stageable files, verify `wsd.json` is included alongside `file_hashes.keys()`\n\n3. **Installable File List**: Get installable files, verify `wsd.json` is NOT included\n\n### Error Handling Tests\n\n1. **Missing wsd.json**: Attempt to read manifest from directory without `wsd.json`, verify clear error and instructions\n\n2. **Missing file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` without `file_hashes` field, verify error points to `pre_staging.py`\n\n3. **Empty file_hashes**: Read `wsd.json` with empty `file_hashes`, verify error is raised (empty file_hashes is never valid)\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Pipeline Flow**: Run `pre_staging.py`, then `stage_release.py`, then `build_package.py`, verify all stages use manifest file list\n\n2. **Staged File Verification**: After staging, verify staged files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` + `wsd.json`\n\n3. **Install File Verification**: After install, verify installed files exactly match `file_hashes.keys()` (without `wsd.json`)\n\n4. **Update File Verification**: Run update operation, verify file categorization uses manifest-based file list\n\n### Regression Tests\n\n1. **No collect_wsd_files Calls**: After implementation, grep codebase to verify `collect_wsd_files()` only called in `pre_staging.py`\n\n2. **Exclusion Consistency**: Verify files excluded by `pre_staging.py` (via `.wsdignore`, suspicious patterns) are consistently absent from all pipeline stages\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Pipeline Script Maintainers\n\n1. **Never Add New Scanning**: If you need a file list, read it from the manifest. Do not add new `collect_wsd_files()` calls.\n\n2. **Trust the Manifest**: Do not add redundant file existence checks. Let copy operations fail naturally if files are missing.\n\n3. **Run Pre-Staging First**: Before any pipeline operation, ensure `pre_staging.py` has been run to generate/update the manifest.\n\n### For Developers Modifying File Lists\n\n1. **Single Point of Change**: To add/remove files from WSD Runtime, modify the source directory and run `pre_staging.py`. The manifest updates automatically.\n\n2. **No Manual Manifest Edits**: Do not manually edit `file_hashes` in `wsd.json`. It is generated by `pre_staging.py`.\n\n3. **Use .wsdignore for Exclusions**: To exclude files from the WSD Runtime, add them to `.wsdignore` rather than adding special-case logic.\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Prerequisite feature that populates `wsd.json` with `file_hashes`; the source of truth generator\n- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file list retrieval\n- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Build process that consumes staged files\n- **Installation-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based installation\n- **Update-System.md**: Will be updated to use manifest-based file categorization\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Documents `file_hashes` field and `installation_only` array\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Manifest-Driven Pipeline including manifest-based file list derivation, the two file list categories, pipeline stage modifications, and error handling.

These hashes enable accurate file comparison during install and update operations by comparing target file content against known source content.\n   156→\n   157→**Hash Format**: Each hash value follows the format `sha256:<hex_digest>` where:\n   158→- `sha256` is the algorithm prefix (for future-proofing)\n   159→- `:` is a separator character\n   160→- `<hex_digest>` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (256 bits / 4 bits per hex char)\n   161→\n   162→**Path Requirements**:\n   163→- Keys are relative paths from WSD Runtime root\n   164→- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n   165→- Must match the path format used elsewhere in wsd.json\n   166→\n   167→**Which Files Are Hashed**:\n   168→- All files that are copied during installation receive hashes\n   169→- Files listed in the `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (they are not copied to destination)\n   170→- The `.wsdignore` file (if present) is NOT hashed (excluded from staging)\n   171→\n   172→**Usage**: Hashes are generated during the pre-staging process by `pre_staging.py` and written to wsd.json before distribution. During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n   173→\n   174→**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n   175→\n   176→### required_directories\n   177→\n   178→**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n   179→**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n   180→**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n   181→\n   182→**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n   183→\n   184→**How It Works**:\n   185→- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n   186→- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n   187→- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n   188→- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n   189→\n   190→**Path Requirements**:\n   191→- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n   192→- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n   193→- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n   194→- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n   195→\n   196→**Why This Design**:\n   197→- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n   198→- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n   199→- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n   200→- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n   201→\n   202→**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n   203→\n   204→## Key Concepts\n   205→\n   206→**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest. See Update-System.md for policy application details.\n   207→\n   208→**Installation Exclusion**: Files declared in the installation_only array are never copied during installation.

This specification defines the authoritative schema for wsd.json structure and field semantics.\n\nFor how wsd.json is used during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md respectively.\n\n## File Location\n\n**File Name**: `wsd.json`\n**Location**: WSD Runtime root directory\n**Format**: JSON (UTF-8 encoded)\n**Distribution**: NOT copied during installation (see Installation-System.md for exclusion rule details)\n\n## JSON Schema\n\n```json\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#\",\n    \"title\": \"WSD Runtime Metadata\",\n    \"description\": \"Metadata file declaring WSD Runtime version and policies\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"required\": [\"version\"],\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"version\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Semantic version of this WSD Runtime release (e.g., '1.0.0')\",\n            \"pattern\": \"^\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+\\\\.\\\\d+$\"\n        },\n        \"installation_only\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Files required for installation operations but not copied to destination\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        },\n        \"no_overwrite\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Files protected from being overwritten during updates\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        },\n        \"executable\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Files requiring executable (+x) permission\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        },\n        \"file_hashes\": {\n            \"type\": \"object\",\n            \"description\": \"SHA-256 content hashes for files in WSD Runtime\",\n            \"additionalProperties\": {\n                \"type\": \"string\",\n                \"pattern\": \"^sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}$\"\n            },\n            \"default\": {}\n        },\n        \"required_directories\": {\n            \"type\": \"array\",\n            \"description\": \"Directories that must exist in the target project\",\n            \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"},\n            \"uniqueItems\": true,\n            \"default\": []\n        }\n    },\n    \"additionalProperties\": false\n}\n```\n\n## Field Specifications\n\n### version\n\n**Type**: String (semantic version: `major.minor.patch`)\n**Required**: Yes\n**Pattern**: `^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$`\n**Example**: `\"1.2.3\"`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares the WSD Runtime release version for tracking and compatibility checks.\n\n**Constraints**:\n- Must match semantic version pattern\n- Incremented per semantic versioning rules (major.minor.patch)\n\n### installation_only\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"wsd.json\", \".DS_Store\", \"build-templates.py\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files are required for installation operations but should not be copied to the destination project during installation.\n\n**Usage**: Files that are needed by the WSD Runtime source to perform installations/updates but serve no purpose once WSD is integrated into a user's project. Common examples include wsd.json itself (which contains installation metadata but has no operational role in the destination) and system files like .DS_Store.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Files do NOT need to exist in WSD Runtime (they may be generated at build time)\n\n**Note**: Unlike no_overwrite and executable arrays, installation_only paths are not validated for existence. This allows declaring build-time generated files (e.g., `__init__.py` for PyPI packages) that should be excluded from installation. For exclusion mechanism implementation, see Installation-System.md § File Copying Process and the FIP in Install-And-Update-Overview.md.\n\n### no_overwrite\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files should never be overwritten during updates when they exist in target.\n\n**Usage**: Files where user customization IS the primary purpose (like Action-Plan.md which IS the user's project plan). For files with customizable sections, use WORKSCOPE-DEV tags instead.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n\n**Note**: For policy behavior during updates and distinction from WORKSCOPE-DEV tags, see Update-System.md and Template-System.md § File Protection.\n\n### executable\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"scripts/health_check.py\", \"wsd.py\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which files require executable (+x) permission.\n\n**Why Needed**: Distribution mechanisms (ZIP, web fetch) may not preserve file permissions. Explicit declaration ensures scripts remain executable.\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only\n- Must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n\n**Note**: For permission application details and conservative approach rationale, see Template-System.md § File Permission Model.\n\n### file_hashes\n\n**Type**: Object (dictionary mapping relative paths to hash strings)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty object)\n**Example**:\n```json\n{\n    \".claude/agents/task-master.md\": \"sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:abc123def456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\"\n}\n```\n\n**Purpose**: Stores pre-computed SHA-256 content hashes for files in WSD Runtime. These hashes enable accurate file comparison during install and update operations by comparing target file content against known source content.\n\n**Hash Format**: Each hash value follows the format `sha256:<hex_digest>` where:\n- `sha256` is the algorithm prefix (for future-proofing)\n- `:` is a separator character\n- `<hex_digest>` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (256 bits / 4 bits per hex char)\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Keys are relative paths from WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n- Must match the path format used elsewhere in wsd.json\n\n**Which Files Are Hashed**:\n- All files that are copied during installation receive hashes\n- Files listed in the `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (they are not copied to destination)\n- The `.wsdignore` file (if present) is NOT hashed (excluded from staging)\n\n**Usage**: Hashes are generated during the pre-staging process by `pre_staging.py` and written to wsd.json before distribution. During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n\n**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n\n### required_directories\n\n**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n**Example**: `[\"docs/workbench\", \"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\"]`\n\n**Purpose**: Declares which directories must exist in the target project. During installation, these directories are created if they don't exist. This replaces the previous approach of tracking `.wsdkeep` placeholder files in `file_hashes`.\n\n**How It Works**:\n- The pre-staging script scans the WSD Runtime for `.wsdkeep` files\n- For each `.wsdkeep` file found (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`), the parent directory path is extracted (`docs/workbench`)\n- These directory paths are stored in the `required_directories` array\n- During installation, WSD creates these directories in the target project and generates `.wsdkeep` files as needed to ensure git tracks empty directories\n\n**Path Requirements**:\n- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n- Directory paths only (not file paths)\n- Must be stored in sorted order for deterministic output\n\n**Why This Design**:\n- `.wsdkeep` files are structural artifacts indicating directory requirements, not content files\n- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n\n**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest. See Update-System.md for policy application details.\n\n**Installation Exclusion**: Files declared in the installation_only array are never copied during installation. See Installation-System.md for exclusion rule details and rationale.\n\n## Complete Examples\n\n### Example 1: Minimal wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Early WSD version with no protected files and minimal executable scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Only version declared (required field)\n- installation_only defaults to empty array (no installation exclusions)\n- no_overwrite defaults to empty array (no protected files)\n- executable defaults to empty array (no executable files)\n- Valid but minimal\n\n**Note**: This is valid but impractical. Real WSD installations typically need executable scripts, installation exclusions, and may protect user-owned files.\n\n### Example 2: Typical wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Standard WSD Runtime with protection for user-owned files and executable scripts\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"installation_only\": [\n    \"wsd.json\"\n  ],\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\"\n  ],\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\": \"sha256:b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcde\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\": \"sha256:c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Version declared: v1.0.0\n- One installation exclusion: wsd.json (not copied to destination)\n- Three protected files: user's Action Plan, PRD, and Developer Notes\n- Three executable scripts: health check, journal init, file protection hook\n- Content hashes for files that are copied during installation\n- Represents common WSD configuration\n\n### Example 3: Comprehensive wsd.json\n\n**Use Case**: Mature WSD Runtime with multiple protected files, extensive script collection, custom installation-only files, and content hashes\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.2.5\",\n  \"installation_only\": [\n    \"wsd.json\",\n    \".DS_Store\",\n    \"build-templates.py\",\n    \"DISTRIBUTION-NOTES.md\"\n  ],\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\",\n    \"config/local-settings.json\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.js\",\n    \"scripts/update_docs.py\",\n    \"scripts/file_list.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \"scripts/archive_claude_sessions.py\",\n    \"scripts/new_prompt.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_pdoc.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_python.py\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_typedoc.js\",\n    \"scripts/codedocs_typescript.js\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\",\n    \"wsd.py\"\n  ],\n  \"file_hashes\": {\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\": \"sha256:a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcd\",\n    \"scripts/health_check.js\": \"sha256:b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcde\",\n    \"wsd.py\": \"sha256:c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\": \"sha256:d4e5f6789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234abcdef01\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Analysis**:\n- Version: v1.2.5 (mature release with patch updates)\n- Four installation exclusions: wsd.json, .DS_Store, build script, and distribution notes (not copied to user projects)\n- Four protected files: Action Plan, PRD, Developer Notes, and local settings (user's core documents)\n- Comprehensive executable list: all scripts requiring direct execution\n- Content hashes for installed files enabling accurate update detection\n- Includes both Python and TypeScript/JavaScript scripts (language-agnostic WSD)\n- wsd.py itself declared executable (can run as `./wsd.py`)\n\n\n## Validation Rules\n\n**Structural Requirements**:\n- version field required and must match semantic version pattern\n- installation_only, no_overwrite, executable, file_hashes, and required_directories are optional\n- Array fields default to empty arrays; file_hashes defaults to empty object\n- All paths must be strings\n- No duplicate paths in any array\n\n**Referential Integrity**:\n- Paths in installation_only do NOT require file existence (may be build-time generated)\n- All paths in no_overwrite must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n- All paths in executable must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n- All paths in file_hashes must reference files that exist in WSD Runtime\n- All paths in required_directories must reference directories derived from `.wsdkeep` file locations\n- Paths use forward slashes (Unix-style)\n\n**Hash Validation**:\n- Hash values must match pattern `sha256:[a-f0-9]{64}` (algorithm prefix + 64 lowercase hex chars)\n- Hash keys (paths) must not include files listed in installation_only\n- Hash keys (paths) must not include `.wsdkeep` files (these are tracked via required_directories)\n- Hash count should match the number of installed files (excluding installation_only and `.wsdkeep` files)\n\n**Logical Constraints**:\n- Version must increment properly between releases\n- All arrays contain unique paths only\n- Files in installation_only should not overlap with operational files (by design)\n- Files in installation_only should not appear in file_hashes (they are not copied)\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n**For operational behavior**:\n- Installation-System.md (how wsd.json is used during installation)\n- Update-System.md (how policies are applied during updates)\n- Template-System.md (file permission model, no_overwrite vs WORKSCOPE-DEV tags)\n- Content-Hashing-Overview.md (hash calculation algorithm, comparison logic, staging integration)\n\n**For related structures**:\n- WSD-Manifest-Schema.md (.wsd manifest structure)\n- System-Architecture.md (architectural context)\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative structure and semantics of the wsd.json metadata file.

It consolidates wsd.json management functionality that was previously split between an agent command (`/update-wsd-json`) and the staging script (`stage_release.py`), moving these operations earlier in the release pipeline so that changes are tracked in the WSD Development repository.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the complete pre-staging process including file collection, validation of metadata arrays, executable list synchronization, hash generation, version auto-increment logic, and wsd.json updates.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context and how the Pre-Staging Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Pre-Staging Script serves five critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Metadata Validation**: Validates that files referenced in `no_overwrite`, `executable`, and `installation_only` arrays still exist in `source/`, preventing metadata drift from the actual file structure\n    20→\n    21→2. **Executable Synchronization**: Synchronizes the `executable` array with actual file permissions by detecting files with the `+x` bit set, ensuring the executable list reflects reality rather than manual maintenance\n    22→\n    23→3. **Hash Generation**: Generates SHA-256 content hashes for all WSD Runtime files (excluding `installation_only` files) and writes them to `source/wsd.json`, enabling repository tracking of file content state\n    24→\n    25→4. **Version Management**: Auto-increments the patch version when any tracked changes are detected (hashes, executable list, or metadata arrays), ensuring version reflects content changes\n    26→\n    27→5. **Pipeline Position Shift**: Moves wsd.json updates from the staging phase (which writes to a target directory) to a pre-staging phase (which writes to `source/`), making all wsd.json changes visible in version control before staging\n    28→\n    29→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of the pre-staging algorithm, validation rules, executable detection logic, version increment triggers, and the relationship to the stage release script.\n    30→\n    31→## Script Architecture\n    32→\n    33→### Script Location\n    34→\n    35→The script lives at `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n    36→\n    37→- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n    38→- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools (like `stage_release.py`)\n    39→- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n    40→\n    41→**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates ON `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n    42→\n    43→### Command Interface\n    44→\n    45→```bash\n    46→# Run pre-staging with default behavior\n    47→uv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py\n    48→\n    49→# Preview what would change (no writes)\n    50→uv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --dry-run\n    51→\n    52→# Show detailed operation progress\n    53→uv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --verbose\n    54→```\n    55→\n    56→### CLI Flags\n    57→\n    58→| Flag        | Description                                                    |\n    59→| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    60→| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing to `source/wsd.json`           |\n    61→| `--verbose` | Display detailed progress including individual file operations |\n    62→\n    63→### Exit Codes\n    64→\n    65→| Code | Meaning                                     |\n    66→| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |\n    67→| `0`  | Success (including \"no changes needed\")     |\n    68→| `1`  | Error (validation failure, I/O error, etc.) |\n    69→\n    70→### Behavioral Guarantees\n    71→\n    72→| Aspect            | Behavior                                                              |\n    73→| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n    74→| Target            | Always operates on `source/wsd.json`                                  |\n    75→| File collection   | Uses `wsd_utils.collect_wsd_files()`                                  |\n    76→| Hash calculation  | Uses `wsd_utils.calculate_file_hash()`                                |\n    77→| Version increment | Auto-increments patch version on any detected change                  |\n    78→| Idempotency       | Running twice with no file changes produces no wsd.json modifications |\n    79→\n    80→## Pipeline Position\n    81→\n    82→The Pre-Staging Script fits into the release pipeline as follows:\n    83→\n    84→```\n    85→source/wsd.json (base state)\n    86→        |\n    87→        v\n    88→pre_staging.py       <-- VALIDATES, HASHES, VERSION BUMPS\n    89→        |\n    90→        v\n    91→source/wsd.json (with file_hashes, synced executable, updated version)\n    92→        |\n    93→        v\n    94→git commit           <-- CHANGES TRACKED IN REPOSITORY\n    95→        |\n    96→        v\n    97→stage_release.py     <-- COPIES FILES AS-IS (no wsd.json modifications)\n    98→        |\n    99→        v\n   100→staging directory (ready for build_package.py)\n   101→```\n   102→\n   103→**Key Change from Previous Design**: Previously, `stage_release.py` generated hashes and wrote them to the TARGET directory's wsd.json.

Determine the correct destination and remove the entry from the other array.\n   699→\n   700→### Error Recovery Principles\n   701→\n   702→**Guarantee**: If any error occurs, `source/wsd.json` remains unchanged. The script validates all inputs before making any modifications.\n   703→\n   704→**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The idempotent design ensures consistent results.\n   705→\n   706→## Design Decisions\n   707→\n   708→### Why Pre-Staging Instead of In-Staging\n   709→\n   710→**Problem**: Previously, hash generation happened in `stage_release.py`, writing hashes to the TARGET directory. This meant:\n   711→- Hashes were never tracked in the WSD Development repository\n   712→- Version bumps during staging were not recorded in source\n   713→- The source wsd.json was always one step behind the staged version\n   714→\n   715→**Solution**: Moving hash generation to a dedicated pre-staging script that writes to `source/wsd.json` ensures all changes are tracked in version control before staging.\n   716→\n   717→**Alternatives Considered:**\n   718→- **Modify stage_release.py to write back to source**: Would create confusing bidirectional data flow and violate single-responsibility\n   719→- **Keep agent command for wsd.json updates**: Agent-driven updates are slow, error-prone, and not deterministic\n   720→\n   721→### Manual Pipeline Execution\n   722→\n   723→Each script in the pipeline runs manually and independently:\n   724→\n   725→```\n   726→pre_staging.py -> stage_release.py -> build_package.py -> validate_package.py\n   727→```\n   728→\n   729→**Rationale**: Each step may require review or intervention. Automatic chaining could mask issues or create unexpected side effects.\n   730→\n   731→### installation_only Is Manual-Add Only\n   732→\n   733→The script NEVER automatically adds files to `installation_only`. It only removes entries for files that no longer exist.\n   734→\n   735→**Rationale**: Adding files to `installation_only` is a significant decision (those files will not be copied during installation). This requires explicit developer intent and should not happen automatically.\n   736→\n   737→## Out of Scope\n   738→\n   739→The following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:\n   740→\n   741→1. **Grand Build Script**: A master script that chains pre_staging → stage_release → build_package → validate_package is future work\n   742→2. **Major/Minor Version Bumping**: Only patch version auto-increments; major and minor version changes require manual editing\n   743→3. **installation_only Auto-Detection**: The script does not automatically determine which files should be in `installation_only`\n   744→4. **Cross-Script Validation**: The script does not check if other pipeline scripts have been run; each script owns its responsibilities independently\n   745→\n   746→## Testing Scenarios\n   747→\n   748→### Basic Pre-Staging Tests\n   749→\n   750→1. **Clean Run**: Run on clean source/, verify wsd.json updated with correct hashes and no version bump (if no changes)\n   751→\n   752→2. **Content Change Detection**: Modify a file in source/, run pre-staging, verify hash changes and version increments\n   753→\n   754→3. **New File Detection**: Add new file to source/, run pre-staging, verify hash added and version increments\n   755→\n   756→4. **File Removal Detection**: Delete file from source/, run pre-staging, verify hash removed and version increments\n   757→\n   758→5. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no changes written, verify output shows what would change\n   759→\n   760→### Executable Sync Tests\n   761→\n   762→1. **Add Executable**: Set `+x` on file, run pre-staging, verify file added to executable array\n   763→\n   764→2. **Remove Executable**: Remove `+x` from file, run pre-staging, verify file removed from executable array\n   765→\n   766→3. **Mixed Permissions**: Have files with and without `+x`, verify only +x files in executable array\n   767→\n   768→### Metadata Validation Tests\n   769→\n   770→1. **no_overwrite Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to no_overwrite, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n   771→\n   772→2. **installation_only Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to installation_only, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n   773→\n   774→3. **Valid Metadata**: Run with all valid metadata entries, verify no removals\n   775→\n   776→### Version Increment Tests\n   777→\n   778→1. **No Changes**: Run twice with no file changes, verify version unchanged on second run\n   779→\n   780→2. **Hash Change**: Modify file content, verify patch version increments\n   781→\n   782→3. **Executable Change**: Change file permissions, verify patch version increments\n   783→\n   784→4. **Metadata Cleanup**: Remove file referenced in no_overwrite, verify patch version increments\n   785→\n   786→### Error Handling Tests\n   787→\n   788→1. **Missing wsd.json**: Run with no wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n   789→\n   790→2. **Invalid JSON**: Run with malformed wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n   791→\n   792→3. **Collection Error**: Create __pycache__ in source/, verify error from collect_wsd_files\n   793→\n   794→4. **Permission Error**: Make file unreadable, verify clear error message\n   795→\n   796→### Integration Tests\n   797→\n   798→1. **Full Pipeline**: Run pre_staging.py, then stage_release.py, verify staged wsd.json matches source wsd.json\n   799→\n   800→2. **Idempotency**: Run pre_staging.py twice, verify second run produces no changes\n   801→\n   802→## Best Practices\n   803→\n   804→### For Release Managers\n   805→\n   806→1. **Run Before Staging**: Always run `pre_staging.py` before `stage_release.py` to ensure wsd.json is current\n   807→\n   808→2. **Review Changes**: Check git diff after running to understand what changed in wsd.json\n   809→\n   810→3. **Use Dry Run First**: Run with `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying\n   811→\n   812→### For Developers\n   813→\n   814→1. **Keep source/ Clean**: Ensure no development artifacts exist in source/ before running\n   815→\n   816→2. **Set Permissions Explicitly**: If a file should be executable in the distributed runtime, ensure it has `+x` in source/\n   817→\n   818→3. **Manual Metadata Changes**: To add files to `no_overwrite` or `installation_only`, edit wsd.json manually before running pre_staging.py\n   819→\n   820→## Related Specifications\n   821→\n   822→- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Staging script that runs after pre-staging;

It consolidates wsd.json management functionality that was previously split between an agent command (`/update-wsd-json`) and the staging script (`stage_release.py`), moving these operations earlier in the release pipeline so that changes are tracked in the WSD Development repository.\n\nThis specification defines the complete pre-staging process including file collection, validation of metadata arrays, executable list synchronization, hash generation, version auto-increment logic, and wsd.json updates.\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Pre-Staging Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md** and **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Pre-Staging Script serves five critical functions:\n\n1. **Metadata Validation**: Validates that files referenced in `no_overwrite`, `executable`, and `installation_only` arrays still exist in `source/`, preventing metadata drift from the actual file structure\n\n2. **Executable Synchronization**: Synchronizes the `executable` array with actual file permissions by detecting files with the `+x` bit set, ensuring the executable list reflects reality rather than manual maintenance\n\n3. **Hash Generation**: Generates SHA-256 content hashes for all WSD Runtime files (excluding `installation_only` files) and writes them to `source/wsd.json`, enabling repository tracking of file content state\n\n4. **Version Management**: Auto-increments the patch version when any tracked changes are detected (hashes, executable list, or metadata arrays), ensuring version reflects content changes\n\n5. **Pipeline Position Shift**: Moves wsd.json updates from the staging phase (which writes to a target directory) to a pre-staging phase (which writes to `source/`), making all wsd.json changes visible in version control before staging\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of the pre-staging algorithm, validation rules, executable detection logic, version increment triggers, and the relationship to the stage release script.\n\n## Script Architecture\n\n### Script Location\n\nThe script lives at `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n\n- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools (like `stage_release.py`)\n- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates ON `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n\n### Command Interface\n\n```bash\n# Run pre-staging with default behavior\nuv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py\n\n# Preview what would change (no writes)\nuv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --dry-run\n\n# Show detailed operation progress\nuv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --verbose\n```\n\n### CLI Flags\n\n| Flag        | Description                                                    |\n| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `--dry-run` | Preview changes without writing to `source/wsd.json`           |\n| `--verbose` | Display detailed progress including individual file operations |\n\n### Exit Codes\n\n| Code | Meaning                                     |\n| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |\n| `0`  | Success (including \"no changes needed\")     |\n| `1`  | Error (validation failure, I/O error, etc.) |\n\n### Behavioral Guarantees\n\n| Aspect            | Behavior                                                              |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Target            | Always operates on `source/wsd.json`                                  |\n| File collection   | Uses `wsd_utils.collect_wsd_files()`                                  |\n| Hash calculation  | Uses `wsd_utils.calculate_file_hash()`                                |\n| Version increment | Auto-increments patch version on any detected change                  |\n| Idempotency       | Running twice with no file changes produces no wsd.json modifications |\n\n## Pipeline Position\n\nThe Pre-Staging Script fits into the release pipeline as follows:\n\n```\nsource/wsd.json (base state)\n        |\n        v\npre_staging.py       <-- VALIDATES, HASHES, VERSION BUMPS\n        |\n        v\nsource/wsd.json (with file_hashes, synced executable, updated version)\n        |\n        v\ngit commit           <-- CHANGES TRACKED IN REPOSITORY\n        |\n        v\nstage_release.py     <-- COPIES FILES AS-IS (no wsd.json modifications)\n        |\n        v\nstaging directory (ready for build_package.py)\n```\n\n**Key Change from Previous Design**: Previously, `stage_release.py` generated hashes and wrote them to the TARGET directory's wsd.json. This meant hashes were never tracked in version control. The pre-staging script moves this work earlier so all wsd.json modifications happen in `source/` and are captured by git.\n\n## Pre-Staging Algorithm\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef pre_staging(source_dir: Path, dry_run: bool = False, verbose: bool = False) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Validate and update source/wsd.json with hashes, executable list, and version.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to source/ directory\n        dry_run: If True, preview only without making changes\n        verbose: If True, display detailed progress\n\n    Raises:\n        SystemExit: On validation failure or I/O error\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phase 1: Load current wsd.json\n    wsd_json = load_wsd_json(source_dir)\n    original_state = deep_copy(wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 2: Collect valid files\n    files = collect_wsd_files(source_dir)\n\n    # Phase 2.5: Extract required_directories from .wsdkeep files\n    wsd_json['required_directories'] = extract_required_directories(files)\n    validate_required_directories(wsd_json['required_directories'], files, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 3: Validate metadata arrays\n    validate_no_overwrite_exists(wsd_json, files, verbose)\n    validate_installation_only_exists(wsd_json, verbose)\n    validate_executable_exists(wsd_json, files, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 4: Sync executable list from actual permissions\n    wsd_json['executable'] = sync_executable_list(files, source_dir, verbose)\n\n    # Phase 5: Generate file hashes (excluding installation_only and .wsdkeep)\n    installation_only = set(wsd_json.get('installation_only', []))\n    wsd_json['file_hashes'] = generate_file_hashes(files, source_dir, installation_only)\n\n    # Phase 5.5: Validate manifest exclusivity\n    validate_manifest_exclusivity(wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 6: Check for changes and bump version if needed\n    if has_changes(original_state, wsd_json):\n        wsd_json['version'] = increment_patch_version(wsd_json['version'])\n\n    # Phase 7: Write updated wsd.json (unless dry-run)\n    if not dry_run:\n        write_wsd_json(source_dir, wsd_json)\n\n    # Phase 8: Generate summary report\n    generate_summary(original_state, wsd_json, dry_run)\n```\n\n### Phase Details\n\n#### Phase 1: Load Current wsd.json\n\nThe script MUST load and parse the existing `source/wsd.json` file:\n\n```python\ndef load_wsd_json(source_dir: Path) -> dict:\n    \"\"\"Load wsd.json from source directory.\"\"\"\n    wsd_json_path = source_dir / \"wsd.json\"\n\n    if not wsd_json_path.exists():\n        raise SystemExit(\"ERROR: source/wsd.json does not exist\")\n\n    with wsd_json_path.open(encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        return json.load(f)\n```\n\n**Error Handling**: If wsd.json does not exist or cannot be parsed, the script MUST exit with a clear error message.\n\n#### Phase 2: Collect Valid Files\n\nThe script MUST use `wsd_utils.collect_wsd_files()` to obtain the list of valid files in `source/`:\n\n```python\nfrom wsd_utils import collect_wsd_files, WsdCollectionError\n\ntry:\n    files = collect_wsd_files(source_dir)\nexcept WsdCollectionError as e:\n    raise SystemExit(f\"ERROR: {e.message}\")\n```\n\nThis function handles:\n- Suspicious file detection (development artifacts)\n- Symlink detection\n- Empty directory detection\n- .wsdignore exclusions\n- Binary file detection\n\nFor complete file collection specification, see **wsd_utils.py** documentation.\n\n#### Phase 2.5: Extract and Validate required_directories\n\nThe script MUST extract directory paths from .wsdkeep files and populate the `required_directories` array:\n\n```python\ndef extract_required_directories(files: list[Path]) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Extract required directory paths from .wsdkeep files.\n\n    Scans the collected files for .wsdkeep placeholder files and extracts\n    the parent directory path for each. These directories represent locations\n    that must exist in target projects during installation.\n\n    Args:\n        files: List of collected file paths relative to source directory.\n\n    Returns:\n        Sorted list of directory paths (without trailing slashes) derived\n        from .wsdkeep file locations. For example, 'docs/workbench/.wsdkeep'\n        yields 'docs/workbench'.\n    \"\"\"\n    directories: set[str] = set()\n\n    for file_path in files:\n        if file_path.name == \".wsdkeep\":\n            # Get the parent directory path\n            parent_dir = str(file_path.parent)\n            # Normalize path separators for cross-platform consistency\n            parent_dir = parent_dir.replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")\n            # Handle edge case where .wsdkeep is at root (parent would be '.')\n            if parent_dir and parent_dir != \".\":\n                directories.add(parent_dir)\n\n    return sorted(directories)\n```\n\n**Extraction Rules:**\n\n1. **Detection**: Scan all collected files for `.wsdkeep` filename\n2. **Parent Path**: Extract the parent directory path from each .wsdkeep location\n3. **Normalization**: Convert backslashes to forward slashes for cross-platform consistency\n4. **Sorting**: Return sorted list for deterministic output and git-friendly diffs\n5. **Root Exclusion**: Skip .wsdkeep files at root level (parent path would be '.')\n\n**Example Extraction:**\n```\nInput files:\n  docs/workbench/.wsdkeep\n  dev/diagnostics/.wsdkeep\n  docs/tickets/open/.wsdkeep\n\nOutput required_directories:\n  [\"dev/diagnostics\", \"docs/tickets/open\", \"docs/workbench\"]\n```\n\nAfter extraction, the script MUST validate referential integrity:\n\n```python\ndef validate_required_directories(\n    required_directories: list[str],\n    files: list[Path],\n    verbose: bool = False,\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate that all required_directories have corresponding .wsdkeep files.\n\n    Ensures referential integrity by verifying that each directory in\n    required_directories corresponds to an actual .wsdkeep file in the\n    collected files list.\n\n    Args:\n        required_directories: List of directory paths to validate.\n        files: List of collected file paths relative to source directory.\n        verbose: If True, log validation status.\n\n    Raises:\n        SystemExit: If any directory has no corresponding .wsdkeep file.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Build set of directories that have .wsdkeep files\n    wsdkeep_dirs = {\n        str(f.parent).replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")\n        for f in files\n        if f.name == \".wsdkeep\" and str(f.parent) != \".\"\n    }\n\n    # Check for orphaned directories (in required_directories but no .wsdkeep)\n    orphaned = set(required_directories) - wsdkeep_dirs\n\n    if orphaned:\n        print(\"ERROR: required_directories entries have no corresponding .wsdkeep file:\")\n        for path in sorted(orphaned):\n            print(f\"  - {path}\")\n        print(\"\\nThese directories should have .wsdkeep files in source/\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"  required_directories: {len(required_directories)} entries validated\")\n```\n\n**Validation Rules:**\n\n1. **Referential Integrity**: Every entry in `required_directories` must have a corresponding `.wsdkeep` file\n2. **Error on Orphans**: If any directory lacks a .wsdkeep file, exit with error listing all orphaned entries\n3. **Verbose Logging**: Report validation success when verbose mode enabled\n\n**Rationale**: This validation prevents metadata drift where `required_directories` claims a directory is required but no .wsdkeep file exists in source/ to mark it.\n\n#### Phase 3: Validate Metadata Arrays\n\nThe script MUST validate metadata arrays according to their modification policies:\n\n**no_overwrite Validation:**\n```python\ndef validate_no_overwrite_exists(\n    wsd_json: dict,\n    files: list[Path],\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate all no_overwrite entries exist in collected files.\"\"\"\n    no_overwrite = set(wsd_json.get('no_overwrite', []))\n    file_paths = {str(f) for f in files}\n\n    missing = no_overwrite - file_paths\n    if missing:\n        # Remove missing entries (file was deleted)\n        wsd_json['no_overwrite'] = [f for f in wsd_json['no_overwrite'] if f not in missing]\n        print(f\"WARNING: Removed {len(missing)} missing files from no_overwrite: {sorted(missing)}\")\n    elif verbose:\n        print(f\"  no_overwrite: {len(no_overwrite)} entries validated\")\n```\n\n**installation_only Validation:**\n```python\ndef validate_installation_only_exists(\n    wsd_json: dict,\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate installation_only array without modification.\n\n    The installation_only array is manually managed and may contain files that\n    don't exist yet (build-time generated files). This function only validates\n    that the array is present and well-formed, without adding or removing entries.\n    \"\"\"\n    installation_only = wsd_json.get('installation_only', [])\n\n    if verbose:\n        print(f\"  installation_only: {len(installation_only)} entries (manual management only)\")\n```\n\n**executable Validation:**\n```python\ndef validate_executable_exists(\n    wsd_json: dict,\n    files: list[Path],\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate all executable entries exist in collected files.\"\"\"\n    executable = set(wsd_json.get('executable', []))\n    file_paths = {str(f) for f in files}\n\n    missing = executable - file_paths\n    if missing:\n        wsd_json['executable'] = [f for f in wsd_json['executable'] if f not in missing]\n        print(f\"WARNING: Removed {len(missing)} missing files from executable: {sorted(missing)}\")\n    elif verbose:\n        print(f\"  executable: {len(executable)} entries validated\")\n```\n\n**Validation Rules:**\n\n1. **no_overwrite**: Files that no longer exist are automatically REMOVED from the array\n2. **installation_only**: Array is NEVER modified (manually managed, may contain build-time files)\n3. **executable**: Files that no longer exist are automatically REMOVED before sync\n\n**Design Constraints**:\n- The script MUST NOT automatically ADD files to no_overwrite or installation_only (manual operations only)\n- The script MUST NOT modify installation_only at all (files may be build-time generated)\n- The executable array is completely regenerated in Phase 4, so validation here only provides logging\n\n#### Phase 4: Sync Executable List\n\nThe script MUST synchronize the `executable` array with actual file permissions:\n\n```python\nimport stat\n\ndef sync_executable_list(\n    files: list[Path],\n    source_dir: Path,\n    verbose: bool = False\n) -> list[str]:\n    \"\"\"Build executable list from actual file permissions.\n\n    Returns list of relative paths for files with +x bit set.\n    \"\"\"\n    executable = []\n\n    for relative_path in files:\n        file_path = source_dir / relative_path\n        try:\n            mode = file_path.stat().st_mode\n            if mode & (stat.S_IXUSR | stat.S_IXGRP | stat.S_IXOTH):\n                executable.append(str(relative_path))\n                if verbose:\n                    print(f\"  Detected executable: {relative_path}\")\n        except OSError:\n            continue\n\n    return sorted(executable)\n```\n\n**Executable Detection Rules:**\n\n1. **Detection**: A file is executable if ANY executable bit is set (user, group, or other)\n2. **Sync Behavior**: The executable array is completely regenerated from file permissions\n3. **Additions**: Files with `+x` bit are added to the array\n4. **Removals**: Files without `+x` bit (or that no longer exist) are removed from the array\n\n**Note on Interpreter-Invoked Scripts**: Files invoked via interpreters (e.g., `uv run python script.py`) do not need the `+x` bit. Only files intended to be directly executed need executable permissions.\n\n#### Phase 5: Generate File Hashes\n\nThe script MUST generate content hashes for all files except those in `installation_only` and .wsdkeep files:\n\n```python\nfrom wsd_utils import calculate_file_hash\n\ndef generate_file_hashes(\n    files: list[Path],\n    source_dir: Path,\n    installation_only: set[str],\n    verbose: bool = False,\n) -> dict[str, str]:\n    \"\"\"Generate SHA-256 hashes for all files except installation_only and .wsdkeep.\n\n    Calculates content hashes for WSD Runtime files, excluding:\n    - Files listed in the installation_only array (not copied during installation)\n    - .wsdkeep placeholder files (tracked via required_directories instead)\n\n    Args:\n        files: List of collected file paths relative to source directory.\n        source_dir: Path to the source/ directory for file access.\n        installation_only: Set of file paths to exclude from hashing.\n        verbose: If True, log individual hash operations.\n\n    Returns:\n        Dictionary mapping relative paths (with forward slashes) to hash strings\n        in format 'sha256:<hex_digest>'.\n    \"\"\"\n    file_hashes: dict[str, str] = {}\n\n    for relative_path in files:\n        # Convert to forward-slash path for cross-platform consistency\n        path_str = str(relative_path).replace(\"\\\\\", \"/\")\n\n        # Skip files in installation_only\n        if path_str in installation_only:\n            if verbose:\n                print(f\"  Skipping (installation_only): {path_str}\")\n            continue\n\n        # Skip .wsdkeep files (tracked via required_directories)\n        if relative_path.name == \".wsdkeep\":\n            if verbose:\n                print(f\"  Skipping (.wsdkeep): {path_str}\")\n            continue\n\n        file_path = source_dir / relative_path\n        file_hashes[path_str] = calculate_file_hash(file_path)\n\n        if verbose:\n            print(f\"  Hashed: {path_str}\")\n\n    return file_hashes\n```\n\n**Hash Generation Rules:**\n\n1. **Algorithm**: SHA-256 via `wsd_utils.calculate_file_hash()`\n2. **Format**: `sha256:<64_lowercase_hex_chars>`\n3. **Exclusions**:\n   - Files in `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (not copied during installation)\n   - `.wsdkeep` files are NOT hashed (tracked via `required_directories` instead)\n4. **Path Format**: Forward slashes for cross-platform consistency\n5. **Verbose Logging**: Report skipped files and hashed files when verbose mode enabled\n\nFor complete hash calculation specification, see **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n#### Phase 5.5: Validate Manifest Exclusivity\n\nThe script MUST validate that `installation_only` and `file_hashes` are mutually exclusive:\n\n```python\ndef validate_manifest_exclusivity(wsd_json: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Validate that installation_only and file_hashes are mutually exclusive.\n\n    Ensures no file paths appear in both the installation_only list and\n    file_hashes dictionary keys. These fields represent semantically opposite\n    destinations: installation_only files are NOT copied to user projects,\n    while file_hashes files ARE copied with hash verification.\n    \"\"\"\n    installation_only = set(wsd_json.get('installation_only', []))\n    file_hashes = set(wsd_json.get('file_hashes', {}).keys())\n\n    overlap = installation_only & file_hashes\n    if overlap:\n        print(\"ERROR: Files cannot appear in both installation_only and file_hashes:\")\n        for path in sorted(overlap):\n            print(f\"  - {path}\")\n        print(\"\\nRemove duplicates from installation_only or file_hashes.\")\n        sys.exit(1)\n```\n\n**Mutual Exclusivity Rules:**\n\n1. **Semantic Conflict**: Files in `installation_only` are NOT copied to user projects, while files in `file_hashes` ARE copied. A file cannot have both behaviors.\n2. **Validation Timing**: Validation occurs after hash generation to catch any conflicting entries before writing to wsd.json.\n3. **Exit on Conflict**: If any overlap is detected, the script MUST exit with code 1 and list all conflicting files.\n\n#### Phase 6: Change Detection and Version Increment\n\nThe script MUST detect changes and auto-increment the patch version:\n\n```python\ndef has_changes(original: dict, current: dict) -> bool:\n    \"\"\"Detect if any tracked fields have changed.\n\n    Compares the original and current wsd.json states to determine if\n    any changes were made that should trigger a version increment.\n\n    Args:\n        original: Original wsd.json state before modifications.\n        current: Current wsd.json state after modifications.\n\n    Returns:\n        True if any tracked field differs, False if identical.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Compare file_hashes dictionaries\n    if original.get('file_hashes', {}) != current.get('file_hashes', {}):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare executable arrays (sorted for order-independent comparison)\n    if sorted(original.get('executable', [])) != sorted(current.get('executable', [])):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare no_overwrite arrays\n    if sorted(original.get('no_overwrite', [])) != sorted(current.get('no_overwrite', [])):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare installation_only arrays\n    if sorted(original.get('installation_only', [])) != sorted(current.get('installation_only', [])):\n        return True\n\n    # Compare required_directories arrays\n    return sorted(original.get('required_directories', [])) != sorted(current.get('required_directories', []))\n\n\ndef increment_patch_version(version: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"Increment patch version (X.Y.Z -> X.Y.Z+1).\"\"\"\n    parts = version.split('.')\n    parts[2] = str(int(parts[2]) + 1)\n    return '.'.join(parts)\n```\n\n**Version Increment Triggers:**\n\nThe patch version MUST be incremented when ANY of the following change:\n\n| Field                   | Change Type                                     |\n| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |\n| `file_hashes`           | Files added, removed, or content changed        |\n| `executable`            | Files added or removed from list                |\n| `no_overwrite`          | Files removed (because they no longer exist)    |\n| `installation_only`     | Files removed (because they no longer exist)    |\n| `required_directories`  | Directories added or removed from list          |\n\n**Version Format**: Semantic versioning `X.Y.Z` where only the patch version (Z) is auto-incremented. Major and minor version changes are manual operations.\n\n#### Phase 7: Write Updated wsd.json\n\nUnless in dry-run mode, the script MUST write the updated wsd.json:\n\n```python\ndef write_wsd_json(source_dir: Path, wsd_json: dict) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Write updated wsd.json to source directory.\"\"\"\n    wsd_json_path = source_dir / \"wsd.json\"\n\n    with wsd_json_path.open('w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        json.dump(wsd_json, f, indent=2)\n        f.write('\\n')  # Trailing newline\n```\n\n**Write Guarantees:**\n\n1. **Atomic**: Write completes fully or fails completely\n2. **Formatting**: JSON with 2-space indentation\n3. **Trailing Newline**: File ends with a single newline character\n\n#### Phase 8: Generate Summary Report\n\nThe script MUST generate a summary of operations performed:\n\n```\n=== Pre-Staging Complete ===\nVersion: 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 (patch bump due to changes)\n\nChanges:\n  File hashes: 127 files hashed (3 changed, 1 added, 0 removed)\n  Executable: 8 files (0 added, 0 removed)\n  Required directories: 14 directories (0 added, 0 removed)\n  no_overwrite: 12 files (0 removed)\n  installation_only: 2 files (0 removed)\n\nUpdated source/wsd.json\n```\n\nFor dry-run mode:\n\n```\n=== Pre-Staging Preview (Dry Run) ===\nVersion: 1.2.3 -> 1.2.4 (would bump due to changes)\n\nChanges detected:\n  File hashes: 3 files changed, 1 added, 0 removed\n  Executable: No changes\n  Required directories: No changes\n  no_overwrite: No changes\n  installation_only: No changes\n\nNo changes written. Run without --dry-run to apply.\n```\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Missing wsd.json\n\n**Error:** `source/wsd.json` does not exist\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: source/wsd.json does not exist\nCannot run pre-staging without an existing wsd.json file.\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Create wsd.json manually with at least the required `version` field.\n\n#### 2. Invalid wsd.json\n\n**Error:** `source/wsd.json` cannot be parsed as JSON\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Failed to parse source/wsd.json\nJSON decode error at line 15: Expecting ',' delimiter\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Fix the JSON syntax error in wsd.json.\n\n#### 3. File Collection Errors\n\n**Error:** `collect_wsd_files()` raises `WsdCollectionError`\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Development artifact directory detected: source/__pycache__/\nPlease clean source/ directory before running pre-staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Remove the development artifact and re-run.\n\n#### 4. Permission Errors\n\n**Error:** Cannot read file for hashing or permission detection\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Cannot read file: source/scripts/health_check.py\nReason: Permission denied\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Fix file permissions and re-run.\n\n#### 5. Manifest Exclusivity Violation\n\n**Error:** A file appears in both `installation_only` and `file_hashes`\n\n**Example Message:**\n```\nERROR: Files cannot appear in both installation_only and file_hashes:\n  - wsd.json\n  - scripts/build_tool.py\n\nRemove duplicates from installation_only or file_hashes.\n```\n\n**Recovery:** Edit `source/wsd.json` to remove the conflicting file from either `installation_only` or `file_hashes`. A file in `installation_only` is NOT copied to user projects (development-only), while a file in `file_hashes` IS copied with hash verification. Determine the correct destination and remove the entry from the other array.\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: If any error occurs, `source/wsd.json` remains unchanged. The script validates all inputs before making any modifications.\n\n**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The idempotent design ensures consistent results.\n\n## Design Decisions\n\n### Why Pre-Staging Instead of In-Staging\n\n**Problem**: Previously, hash generation happened in `stage_release.py`, writing hashes to the TARGET directory. This meant:\n- Hashes were never tracked in the WSD Development repository\n- Version bumps during staging were not recorded in source\n- The source wsd.json was always one step behind the staged version\n\n**Solution**: Moving hash generation to a dedicated pre-staging script that writes to `source/wsd.json` ensures all changes are tracked in version control before staging.\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- **Modify stage_release.py to write back to source**: Would create confusing bidirectional data flow and violate single-responsibility\n- **Keep agent command for wsd.json updates**: Agent-driven updates are slow, error-prone, and not deterministic\n\n### Manual Pipeline Execution\n\nEach script in the pipeline runs manually and independently:\n\n```\npre_staging.py -> stage_release.py -> build_package.py -> validate_package.py\n```\n\n**Rationale**: Each step may require review or intervention. Automatic chaining could mask issues or create unexpected side effects.\n\n### installation_only Is Manual-Add Only\n\nThe script NEVER automatically adds files to `installation_only`. It only removes entries for files that no longer exist.\n\n**Rationale**: Adding files to `installation_only` is a significant decision (those files will not be copied during installation). This requires explicit developer intent and should not happen automatically.\n\n## Out of Scope\n\nThe following are explicitly NOT included in this feature:\n\n1. **Grand Build Script**: A master script that chains pre_staging → stage_release → build_package → validate_package is future work\n2. **Major/Minor Version Bumping**: Only patch version auto-increments; major and minor version changes require manual editing\n3. **installation_only Auto-Detection**: The script does not automatically determine which files should be in `installation_only`\n4. **Cross-Script Validation**: The script does not check if other pipeline scripts have been run; each script owns its responsibilities independently\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Pre-Staging Tests\n\n1. **Clean Run**: Run on clean source/, verify wsd.json updated with correct hashes and no version bump (if no changes)\n\n2. **Content Change Detection**: Modify a file in source/, run pre-staging, verify hash changes and version increments\n\n3. **New File Detection**: Add new file to source/, run pre-staging, verify hash added and version increments\n\n4. **File Removal Detection**: Delete file from source/, run pre-staging, verify hash removed and version increments\n\n5. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no changes written, verify output shows what would change\n\n### Executable Sync Tests\n\n1. **Add Executable**: Set `+x` on file, run pre-staging, verify file added to executable array\n\n2. **Remove Executable**: Remove `+x` from file, run pre-staging, verify file removed from executable array\n\n3. **Mixed Permissions**: Have files with and without `+x`, verify only +x files in executable array\n\n### Metadata Validation Tests\n\n1. **no_overwrite Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to no_overwrite, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n\n2. **installation_only Cleanup**: Add non-existent file to installation_only, run pre-staging, verify entry removed\n\n3. **Valid Metadata**: Run with all valid metadata entries, verify no removals\n\n### Version Increment Tests\n\n1. **No Changes**: Run twice with no file changes, verify version unchanged on second run\n\n2. **Hash Change**: Modify file content, verify patch version increments\n\n3. **Executable Change**: Change file permissions, verify patch version increments\n\n4. **Metadata Cleanup**: Remove file referenced in no_overwrite, verify patch version increments\n\n### Error Handling Tests\n\n1. **Missing wsd.json**: Run with no wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n\n2. **Invalid JSON**: Run with malformed wsd.json, verify clear error and exit code 1\n\n3. **Collection Error**: Create __pycache__ in source/, verify error from collect_wsd_files\n\n4. **Permission Error**: Make file unreadable, verify clear error message\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Pipeline**: Run pre_staging.py, then stage_release.py, verify staged wsd.json matches source wsd.json\n\n2. **Idempotency**: Run pre_staging.py twice, verify second run produces no changes\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Release Managers\n\n1. **Run Before Staging**: Always run `pre_staging.py` before `stage_release.py` to ensure wsd.json is current\n\n2. **Review Changes**: Check git diff after running to understand what changed in wsd.json\n\n3. **Use Dry Run First**: Run with `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying\n\n### For Developers\n\n1. **Keep source/ Clean**: Ensure no development artifacts exist in source/ before running\n\n2. **Set Permissions Explicitly**: If a file should be executable in the distributed runtime, ensure it has `+x` in source/\n\n3. **Manual Metadata Changes**: To add files to `no_overwrite` or `installation_only`, edit wsd.json manually before running pre_staging.py\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Stage-Release-Script-Overview.md**: Staging script that runs after pre-staging; will be simplified to remove hash generation\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm and usage; will be updated to reference pre_staging.py\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Schema for wsd.json including all fields managed by pre_staging.py\n- **Design-Decisions.md § Decision 11**: WSD Development scripts in dev/scripts/ are separate from dogfood\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Pre-Staging Script including the pre-staging algorithm, validation rules, executable synchronization, hash generation, and version increment logic. All implementations must conform to these specifications.*\n\n## Feature Implementation Plan (FIP)\n\n**Important**: This is a script specifically for the WSD Development project and is NOT part of the WSD Runtime.

The staging directory (`../workscope-dev/` by default) serves as the GitHub publishing conduit for the public `rcgray/workscope-dev` repository, enabling clean separation between WSD Development and the distributed WSD Runtime.\n    10→\n    11→This specification defines the complete staging process including file enumeration, exclusion filtering, target directory management, verification procedures, and error handling. The Stage Release Script is a prerequisite to the Build-System feature, which handles subsequent PyPI packaging from the staged files.\n    12→\n    13→For broader architectural context and how the Stage Release Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n    14→\n    15→## Purpose\n    16→\n    17→The Stage Release Script serves four critical functions:\n    18→\n    19→1. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a sanitized copy of WSD Runtime by filtering out development artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `.envrc`) that should not be distributed to end users\n    20→\n    21→2. **Git Separation**: Enables the GitHub publishing workflow by staging files to a separate repository (`../workscope-dev/`) with its own git history, preserving the `.git/` directory during staging operations\n    22→\n    23→3. **Source Purity Enforcement**: Validates that `source/` remains clean by halting on unexpected files (suspicious files, symlinks, empty directories), enforcing Design Decision 9 (Keep WSD Runtime Directory Pure and Ship-Ready)\n    24→\n    25→4. **Release Automation**: Provides a repeatable, idempotent process for preparing releases, eliminating manual file copying and the risk of accidentally shipping development artifacts\n    26→\n    27→This specification establishes the authoritative definition of the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and the `.wsdignore` file format.\n    28→\n    29→## Script Architecture\n    30→\n    31→### Script Location\n    32→\n    33→The script lives at `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n    34→\n    35→- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n    36→- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools\n    37→- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n    38→\n    39→**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates on `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n    40→\n    41→### Command Interface\n    42→\n    43→```bash\n    44→# Stage to default sibling directory (../workscope-dev/)\n    45→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n    46→\n    47→# Preview what would be staged (no actual changes)\n    48→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n    49→\n    50→# Stage to specific directory (for testing)\n    51→uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --target /path/to/target\n    52→```\n    53→\n    54→### Behavioral Guarantees\n    55→\n    56→| Aspect            | Behavior                                |\n    57→| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n    58→| Target default    | `../workscope-dev/` (sibling directory) |\n    59→| Target override   | `--target /path/to/dir` flag            |\n    60→| Verbosity         | Always verbose (lists all files)        |\n    61→| Clean before copy | Always cleans target (except `.git/`)   |\n    62→| Verification      | Always verifies after staging           |\n    63→| Sync mode         | Full sync only (no incremental mode)    |\n    64→| Git operations    | None (user handles git manually)        |\n    65→| Target creation   | Never creates target (must exist)       |\n    66→\n    67→**Guarantee**: The script is idempotent.

If not, the script MUST exit with a clear error message. The script MUST NOT create the target directory.\n   145→\n   146→2. **Git directory validation**: If the target contains `.git/`, it MUST be a real directory, not a symlink. If `.git/` is a symlink, the script MUST halt with an error.\n   147→\n   148→3. **Git warning**: If the target directory does not contain a `.git/` subdirectory, the script SHOULD warn the user (this may indicate incorrect target selection).\n   149→\n   150→#### Phase 2: Load Patterns\n   151→\n   152→Two distinct pattern sets are loaded with different behaviors:\n   153→\n   154→1. **`.wsdignore` entries**: Files listed in `source/.wsdignore` that exist for WSD Development but should not ship. These are **skipped quietly** during staging.\n   155→\n   156→2. **Suspicious file patterns**: Built-in patterns identifying development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. These **cause an error** if detected.\n   157→\n   158→See **Exclusion Pattern System** section for complete pattern list.\n   159→\n   160→#### Phase 3: Pre-scan Source for Errors\n   161→\n   162→Before modifying the target directory, the script MUST validate all source files. This ensures that if any error is detected, the target remains unchanged.\n   163→\n   164→For each item in `source/`:\n   165→\n   166→1. **Check `.wsdignore`**: If item matches a `.wsdignore` entry, log skip and continue\n   167→2. **Check suspicious patterns**: If item matches a suspicious pattern, halt with error (these should not exist)\n   168→3. **Check symlink**: If item is a symlink, halt with error (symlinks are unexpected)\n   169→4. **Check empty directory**: If directory contains no files, halt with error (should have `.wsdkeep`)\n   170→\n   171→**Clarification on empty directories**: A directory containing only a `.wsdkeep` file is NOT empty—it contains a file. The empty directory check catches directories with zero files, which violates WSD conventions.\n   172→\n   173→**Contract**: The script MUST halt on any unexpected condition rather than silently proceeding. Because this validation happens before cleaning, any error leaves the target unchanged.\n   174→\n   175→#### Phase 4: Clean Target Directory\n   176→\n   177→After source validation passes, the target directory is cleaned:\n   178→\n   179→- Remove all files and directories EXCEPT `.git/`\n   180→- Log what was removed (file/directory count)\n   181→- Preserve `.git/` intact (maintains GitHub repository history)\n   182→\n   183→**Contract**: Cleaning is always performed. There is no incremental mode.\n   184→\n   185→#### Phase 5: Copy Files\n   186→\n   187→For each validated file (from Phase 3's staging list):\n   188→\n   189→1. Copy to target preserving relative path structure\n   190→2. Preserve file permissions (especially executable bits)\n   191→3. Log each file as staged\n   192→\n   193→**Guarantee**: File permissions MUST be preserved. Scripts with `+x` in `source/` MUST have `+x` in target.\n   194→\n   195→#### Phase 6: Verify Staging\n   196→\n   197→After copying, the script MUST verify:\n   198→\n   199→1. **File count**: Number of staged files equals the pre-validated staging list size\n   200→2. **Permissions**: Executable files retained their `+x` bit. The script compares against source file permissions to verify. Additionally, `wsd.json` contains a list of files that should be executable, which can serve as a reference.\n   201→\n   202→#### Phase 7: Generate Summary\n   203→\n   204→Report completion status including:\n   205→- Total files staged\n   206→- Total files excluded (with breakdown by reason)\n   207→- Verification results\n   208→- Next steps (git commands for publishing)\n   209→\n   210→### Prerequisite: Pre-Staging Script\n   211→\n   212→The Stage Release Script depends on `pre_staging.py` having been run first. The pre-staging script handles wsd.json metadata management including hash generation, executable list synchronization, and version bumping. The Stage Release Script copies the pre-staged `source/wsd.json` as-is to the target directory.\n   213→\n   214→For hash generation and wsd.json management details, see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md** and **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n   215→\n   216→### .wsdkeep File Handling\n   217→\n   218→.wsdkeep files are **NOT staged**. Although .wsdkeep files exist in `source/` as git placeholders to preserve empty directory structure, they are excluded from the staging process because directory requirements are tracked via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`.\n   219→\n   220→The staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\n   221→\n   222→**Design Rationale**: .wsdkeep files are structural git artifacts, not content files. The manifest declares semantic intent via `required_directories` (\"these directories must exist\"), and install/update operations generate .wsdkeep files locally based on directory state. See **Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files** for the complete .wsdkeep lifecycle.\n   223→\n   224→## Exclusion Pattern System\n   225→\n   226→### Built-in Suspicious File Patterns\n   227→\n   228→These patterns identify development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. If detected, the script MUST halt with an error (unless the file is listed in `.wsdignore`):\n   229→\n   230→| Pattern              | Description                            |\n   231→| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n   232→| `__pycache__/`       | Python bytecode cache directories      |\n   233→| `node_modules/`      | Node.js dependency directories         |\n   234→| `.git/`              | Git repository directories (in source) |\n   235→| `package-lock.json`  | npm lock files                         |\n   236→| `.package-lock.json` | npm hidden lock files                  |\n   237→| `.DS_Store`          | macOS metadata files                   |\n   238→| `desktop.ini`        | Windows metadata files                 |\n   239→| `Thumbs.db`          | Windows thumbnail cache                |\n   240→| `*~`                 | Vim backup files                       |\n   241→| `.*.swp`             | Vim swap files                         |\n   242→| `.*.swo`             | Vim swap files                         |\n   243→| `*.pyc`              | Python bytecode files                  |\n   244→| `*.pyo`              | Python optimized bytecode              |\n   245→| `dist/`              | Build distribution directories         |\n   246→| `build/`             | Build output directories               |\n   247→| `*.egg-info/`        | Python package metadata                |\n   248→\n   249→**Rationale**: These patterns are derived from the `/update-wsd-json` command's suspicious file detection logic, ensuring consistency across WSD Development tooling.\n   250→\n   251→### .wsdignore File Format\n   252→\n   253→The `source/.wsdignore` file lists files that legitimately exist in `source/` for WSD Development but should not be staged for distribution.\n   254→\n   255→**Current contents**:\n   256→```\n   257→.wsdignore\n   258→.envrc\n   259→```\n   260→\n   261→**Format rules**:\n   262→- One file path per line (relative to `source/`)\n   263→- Lines starting with `#` are comments\n   264→- Empty lines are ignored\n   265→- Patterns are matched exactly (no glob expansion)\n   266→\n   267→**Contract**: Files listed in `.wsdignore` are SKIPPED during staging, not treated as errors.\n   268→\n   269→### Exclusion Precedence\n   270→\n   271→1. Check against `.wsdignore` entries (skip if match)\n   272→2. Check against suspicious file patterns (error if match)\n   273→3. Proceed with staging\n   274→\n   275→This order allows `.wsdignore` to whitelist files that would otherwise be flagged as suspicious (though in practice, `.wsdignore` entries are specific to WSD Development, not general patterns).\n   276→\n   277→## Error Handling\n   278→\n   279→### Error Categories\n   280→\n   281→#### 1.

If any error is detected in `source/` (symlinks, empty directories, suspicious files), the target directory remains completely unchanged.\n   351→\n   352→If an error occurs during file copying (Phase 5), the target may be in an inconsistent state (cleaned but partially copied).

The staging directory (`../workscope-dev/` by default) serves as the GitHub publishing conduit for the public `rcgray/workscope-dev` repository, enabling clean separation between WSD Development and the distributed WSD Runtime.\n\nThis specification defines the complete staging process including file enumeration, exclusion filtering, target directory management, verification procedures, and error handling. The Stage Release Script is a prerequisite to the Build-System feature, which handles subsequent PyPI packaging from the staged files.\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Stage Release Script integrates with the distribution pipeline, see **Build-System-Overview.md**.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Stage Release Script serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Clean Distribution**: Creates a sanitized copy of WSD Runtime by filtering out development artifacts (`.DS_Store`, `__pycache__/`, `.envrc`) that should not be distributed to end users\n\n2. **Git Separation**: Enables the GitHub publishing workflow by staging files to a separate repository (`../workscope-dev/`) with its own git history, preserving the `.git/` directory during staging operations\n\n3. **Source Purity Enforcement**: Validates that `source/` remains clean by halting on unexpected files (suspicious files, symlinks, empty directories), enforcing Design Decision 9 (Keep WSD Runtime Directory Pure and Ship-Ready)\n\n4. **Release Automation**: Provides a repeatable, idempotent process for preparing releases, eliminating manual file copying and the risk of accidentally shipping development artifacts\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and the `.wsdignore` file format.\n\n## Script Architecture\n\n### Script Location\n\nThe script lives at `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` in the WSD Development repository. This location is appropriate because:\n\n- The script is a WSD Development tool, NOT part of WSD Runtime\n- It resides in the project's `dev/scripts/` directory alongside other WSD Development-only tools\n- It is not copied to `source/` and will not be distributed to end users\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST NOT be placed in `source/`. It is a development tool that operates on `source/`, not part of the distributable runtime.\n\n### Command Interface\n\n```bash\n# Stage to default sibling directory (../workscope-dev/)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n\n# Preview what would be staged (no actual changes)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n\n# Stage to specific directory (for testing)\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --target /path/to/target\n```\n\n### Behavioral Guarantees\n\n| Aspect            | Behavior                                |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| Target default    | `../workscope-dev/` (sibling directory) |\n| Target override   | `--target /path/to/dir` flag            |\n| Verbosity         | Always verbose (lists all files)        |\n| Clean before copy | Always cleans target (except `.git/`)   |\n| Verification      | Always verifies after staging           |\n| Sync mode         | Full sync only (no incremental mode)    |\n| Git operations    | None (user handles git manually)        |\n| Target creation   | Never creates target (must exist)       |\n\n**Guarantee**: The script is idempotent. Running it twice in succession produces identical results in the target directory.\n\n## Staging Algorithm\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef stage_release(source_dir: Path, target_dir: Path, dry_run: bool = False) -> None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stage WSD Runtime files from source to target directory.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to source/ directory\n        target_dir: Path to staging directory (e.g., ../workscope-dev/)\n        dry_run: If True, preview only without making changes\n\n    Raises:\n        FileNotFoundError: Target directory does not exist\n        ValueError: Source contains unexpected files (symlinks, empty dirs, suspicious files)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Phase 1: Validation\n    validate_target_exists(target_dir)\n    validate_target_git_not_symlink(target_dir)  # .git/ must be real directory, not symlink\n    warn_if_no_git(target_dir)\n\n    # Phase 2: Load patterns\n    wsdignore_entries = load_wsdignore(source_dir)      # Files to skip quietly\n    suspicious_patterns = get_suspicious_patterns()     # Files that should not exist\n\n    # Phase 3: Pre-scan source for errors (before modifying target)\n    files_to_stage = []\n    for item in walk_source(source_dir):\n        # Check .wsdignore first (skip quietly)\n        if matches_wsdignore(item, wsdignore_entries):\n            log_skip(item, \"in .wsdignore\")\n            continue\n\n        # Check suspicious patterns (error - should not exist in source/)\n        if matches_suspicious_pattern(item, suspicious_patterns):\n            raise_suspicious_file_error(item)\n\n        # Check for symlinks (error - unexpected in source/)\n        if is_symlink(item):\n            raise_symlink_error(item)\n\n        # Check for empty directories (error - should have .wsdkeep)\n        if is_empty_directory(item):\n            raise_empty_directory_error(item)\n\n        # Validated - add to staging list\n        files_to_stage.append(item)\n\n    # Phase 4: Clean target directory (safe now - source validated)\n    clean_target(target_dir, preserve=[\".git\"], dry_run=dry_run)\n\n    # Phase 5: Copy files\n    staged_count = 0\n    for item in files_to_stage:\n        copy_with_permissions(item, target_dir, dry_run=dry_run)\n        log_stage(item)\n        staged_count += 1\n\n    # Phase 6: Verify staging\n    if not dry_run:\n        verify_staging(source_dir, target_dir, files_to_stage, staged_count)\n\n    # Phase 7: Generate summary report\n    generate_summary()\n```\n\n### Phase Details\n\n#### Phase 1: Validation\n\nThe script MUST validate preconditions before proceeding:\n\n1. **Target exists**: The target directory MUST exist. If not, the script MUST exit with a clear error message. The script MUST NOT create the target directory.\n\n2. **Git directory validation**: If the target contains `.git/`, it MUST be a real directory, not a symlink. If `.git/` is a symlink, the script MUST halt with an error.\n\n3. **Git warning**: If the target directory does not contain a `.git/` subdirectory, the script SHOULD warn the user (this may indicate incorrect target selection).\n\n#### Phase 2: Load Patterns\n\nTwo distinct pattern sets are loaded with different behaviors:\n\n1. **`.wsdignore` entries**: Files listed in `source/.wsdignore` that exist for WSD Development but should not ship. These are **skipped quietly** during staging.\n\n2. **Suspicious file patterns**: Built-in patterns identifying development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. These **cause an error** if detected.\n\nSee **Exclusion Pattern System** section for complete pattern list.\n\n#### Phase 3: Pre-scan Source for Errors\n\nBefore modifying the target directory, the script MUST validate all source files. This ensures that if any error is detected, the target remains unchanged.\n\nFor each item in `source/`:\n\n1. **Check `.wsdignore`**: If item matches a `.wsdignore` entry, log skip and continue\n2. **Check suspicious patterns**: If item matches a suspicious pattern, halt with error (these should not exist)\n3. **Check symlink**: If item is a symlink, halt with error (symlinks are unexpected)\n4. **Check empty directory**: If directory contains no files, halt with error (should have `.wsdkeep`)\n\n**Clarification on empty directories**: A directory containing only a `.wsdkeep` file is NOT empty—it contains a file. The empty directory check catches directories with zero files, which violates WSD conventions.\n\n**Contract**: The script MUST halt on any unexpected condition rather than silently proceeding. Because this validation happens before cleaning, any error leaves the target unchanged.\n\n#### Phase 4: Clean Target Directory\n\nAfter source validation passes, the target directory is cleaned:\n\n- Remove all files and directories EXCEPT `.git/`\n- Log what was removed (file/directory count)\n- Preserve `.git/` intact (maintains GitHub repository history)\n\n**Contract**: Cleaning is always performed. There is no incremental mode.\n\n#### Phase 5: Copy Files\n\nFor each validated file (from Phase 3's staging list):\n\n1. Copy to target preserving relative path structure\n2. Preserve file permissions (especially executable bits)\n3. Log each file as staged\n\n**Guarantee**: File permissions MUST be preserved. Scripts with `+x` in `source/` MUST have `+x` in target.\n\n#### Phase 6: Verify Staging\n\nAfter copying, the script MUST verify:\n\n1. **File count**: Number of staged files equals the pre-validated staging list size\n2. **Permissions**: Executable files retained their `+x` bit. The script compares against source file permissions to verify. Additionally, `wsd.json` contains a list of files that should be executable, which can serve as a reference.\n\n#### Phase 7: Generate Summary\n\nReport completion status including:\n- Total files staged\n- Total files excluded (with breakdown by reason)\n- Verification results\n- Next steps (git commands for publishing)\n\n### Prerequisite: Pre-Staging Script\n\nThe Stage Release Script depends on `pre_staging.py` having been run first. The pre-staging script handles wsd.json metadata management including hash generation, executable list synchronization, and version bumping. The Stage Release Script copies the pre-staged `source/wsd.json` as-is to the target directory.\n\nFor hash generation and wsd.json management details, see **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md** and **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n### .wsdkeep File Handling\n\n.wsdkeep files are **NOT staged**. Although .wsdkeep files exist in `source/` as git placeholders to preserve empty directory structure, they are excluded from the staging process because directory requirements are tracked via the `required_directories` field in `wsd.json`.\n\nThe staging script reads the file list from `file_hashes.keys()` in the manifest (populated by `pre_staging.py`). Since `pre_staging.py` excludes .wsdkeep files from `file_hashes`, they are never included in the staging file list.\n\n**Design Rationale**: .wsdkeep files are structural git artifacts, not content files. The manifest declares semantic intent via `required_directories` (\"these directories must exist\"), and install/update operations generate .wsdkeep files locally based on directory state. See **Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files** for the complete .wsdkeep lifecycle.\n\n## Exclusion Pattern System\n\n### Built-in Suspicious File Patterns\n\nThese patterns identify development artifacts that should NEVER exist in `source/`. If detected, the script MUST halt with an error (unless the file is listed in `.wsdignore`):\n\n| Pattern              | Description                            |\n| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| `__pycache__/`       | Python bytecode cache directories      |\n| `node_modules/`      | Node.js dependency directories         |\n| `.git/`              | Git repository directories (in source) |\n| `package-lock.json`  | npm lock files                         |\n| `.package-lock.json` | npm hidden lock files                  |\n| `.DS_Store`          | macOS metadata files                   |\n| `desktop.ini`        | Windows metadata files                 |\n| `Thumbs.db`          | Windows thumbnail cache                |\n| `*~`                 | Vim backup files                       |\n| `.*.swp`             | Vim swap files                         |\n| `.*.swo`             | Vim swap files                         |\n| `*.pyc`              | Python bytecode files                  |\n| `*.pyo`              | Python optimized bytecode              |\n| `dist/`              | Build distribution directories         |\n| `build/`             | Build output directories               |\n| `*.egg-info/`        | Python package metadata                |\n\n**Rationale**: These patterns are derived from the `/update-wsd-json` command's suspicious file detection logic, ensuring consistency across WSD Development tooling.\n\n### .wsdignore File Format\n\nThe `source/.wsdignore` file lists files that legitimately exist in `source/` for WSD Development but should not be staged for distribution.\n\n**Current contents**:\n```\n.wsdignore\n.envrc\n```\n\n**Format rules**:\n- One file path per line (relative to `source/`)\n- Lines starting with `#` are comments\n- Empty lines are ignored\n- Patterns are matched exactly (no glob expansion)\n\n**Contract**: Files listed in `.wsdignore` are SKIPPED during staging, not treated as errors.\n\n### Exclusion Precedence\n\n1. Check against `.wsdignore` entries (skip if match)\n2. Check against suspicious file patterns (error if match)\n3. Proceed with staging\n\nThis order allows `.wsdignore` to whitelist files that would otherwise be flagged as suspicious (though in practice, `.wsdignore` entries are specific to WSD Development, not general patterns).\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Target Directory Errors\n\n**Error**: Target directory does not exist\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Target directory does not exist: ../workscope-dev/\nThis directory should be the GitHub repository for rcgray/workscope-dev.\nPlease ensure the repository is cloned to the expected location.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Clone the GitHub repository to the expected location, or use `--target` to specify a different location.\n\n**Error**: Target `.git/` is a symlink\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Target .git/ is a symlink: ../workscope-dev/.git -> /other/repo/.git\nThe .git directory must be a real directory, not a symlink.\nThis may indicate a git worktree or other non-standard setup.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Use a standard git clone for the target repository, or use `--target` to specify a different location.\n\n#### 2. Symlink Errors\n\n**Error**: Symlink detected in source\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Symlink detected in source/: source/scripts/link.py -> ../other.py\nSymlinks are not expected in the WSD Runtime source.\nPlease investigate and resolve before staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Remove the symlink and replace with actual file, or determine why it was created.\n\n**Rationale**: Symlinks are unexpected in `source/` and may indicate accidental file creation or architectural issues.\n\n#### 3. Empty Directory Errors\n\n**Error**: Empty directory detected\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Empty directory detected: source/docs/workbench/\nEmpty directories should contain a .wsdkeep file.\nPlease add .wsdkeep or remove the directory.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Add a `.wsdkeep` placeholder file to the directory, or remove the directory if it is not needed.\n\n**Rationale**: Empty directories should have `.wsdkeep` files to ensure they are tracked by git and preserved during installation.\n\n#### 4. Suspicious File Errors\n\n**Error**: Suspicious file detected\n\n**Example Message**:\n```\nERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\nDevelopment artifacts should not exist in source/.\nPlease investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: Remove the suspicious file/directory and investigate how it was created (may indicate a Rule 6.1 violation where code changes were made to `source/` instead of running from the development environment properly).\n\n### Error Recovery Principles\n\n**Guarantee**: Source validation (Phase 3) occurs BEFORE target modification (Phase 4). If any error is detected in `source/` (symlinks, empty directories, suspicious files), the target directory remains completely unchanged.\n\nIf an error occurs during file copying (Phase 5), the target may be in an inconsistent state (cleaned but partially copied). The error message will indicate this.\n\n**Recommendation**: On error, resolve the issue and re-run the script. The clean-before-copy behavior ensures the target will be in a consistent state after a successful run.\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### Dependencies\n\nThe script MUST use Python standard library only:\n- `pathlib` - Path operations\n- `shutil` - File copying with permission preservation\n- `os` - Directory operations\n- `argparse` - Command-line parsing\n\n**Contract**: No external packages required. The script runs with Python 3.10+ (matching WSD requirements).\n\n### Permission Handling\n\nThe script MUST use `shutil.copy2()` for file copying, which preserves file metadata including permission bits.\n\n**Verification**: After staging, the script MUST verify that executable files (those with `+x` in source) retain their executable permission in the target.\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Staging Tests\n\n1. **Default Target Staging**: Run `uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py`, verify files appear in `../workscope-dev/`, verify `.git/` preserved, verify excluded files not present\n\n2. **Custom Target Staging**: Run with `--target /tmp/test-staging`, verify files staged to specified location\n\n3. **Dry Run Mode**: Run with `--dry-run`, verify no files changed, verify output shows what would be staged\n\n4. **Idempotency**: Run script twice in succession, verify target directory identical after both runs\n\n### Edge Case Tests\n\n1. **Missing Target Directory**: Run against non-existent target, verify clear error message, verify no partial operations\n\n2. **Target Without .git**: Run against valid directory without `.git/`, verify warning displayed but staging proceeds\n\n3. **Empty .wsdignore**: Remove all entries from `.wsdignore`, run staging, verify default exclusions still apply\n\n4. **Symlink Detection**: Create symlink in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n\n5. **Empty Directory Detection**: Create empty directory in `source/` (without `.wsdkeep`), run staging, verify error and halt\n\n6. **Suspicious File Detection**: Create `__pycache__/` in `source/`, run staging, verify error and halt\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Release Workflow**: Stage files, then run `build_for_pypi.py` on staged output, verify build succeeds\n\n2. **Permission Preservation**: Stage files including executable scripts, verify `+x` bit preserved on `wsd.py` and scripts\n\n3. **File Count Verification**: Count files in `source/`, count exclusions, verify staged count matches expected\n\n4. **Git Workflow Integration**: Stage files, navigate to target, run `git status`, verify correct files shown as added/modified/deleted\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Standard Staging Operation\n\n**Context**: Developer wants to prepare a release for GitHub publishing.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nCleaning target directory...\n  Preserved: .git/\n  Removed: 127 files, 23 directories\n\nStaging files...\n  STAGE: wsd.py\n  STAGE: wsd.json\n  STAGE: scripts/health_check.py\n  STAGE: scripts/wsd_utils.py\n  SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n  SKIP: .wsdignore (in .wsdignore)\n  STAGE: .claude/agents/task-master.md\n  ...\n\nVerifying staging...\n  File count: 127 staged (2 excluded) - OK\n  Permissions: 8 executable files verified - OK\n\n=== Staging Complete ===\nStaged 127 files to ../workscope-dev/\nNext steps:\n  cd ../workscope-dev\n  git status\n  git add -A && git commit -m \"Release vX.Y.Z\"\n  git push origin main\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The script cleaned the target (preserving `.git/`), copied all source files except those in `.wsdignore`, verified the result, and provided next steps for the developer.\n\n### Example 2: Dry Run Preview\n\n**Context**: Developer wants to see what would be staged without making changes.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging (DRY RUN) ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nPre-scanning source...\n  127 files to stage, 2 to skip\n\nWould clean target directory...\n  Would preserve: .git/\n  Would remove: 127 files, 23 directories\n\nWould stage files...\n  WOULD STAGE: wsd.py\n  WOULD STAGE: wsd.json\n  WOULD SKIP: .envrc (in .wsdignore)\n  ...\n\n=== Dry Run Complete ===\nNo changes made. Run without --dry-run to perform staging.\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The dry run pre-scans the source to determine exact counts, then shows exactly what would happen without making any changes. This allows the developer to verify before committing to the operation.\n\n### Example 3: Error Scenario - Suspicious File\n\n**Context**: Developer accidentally ran a Python command that created `__pycache__/` in `source/`.\n\n**Command**:\n```bash\nuv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n=== WSD Release Staging ===\nSource: /Users/dev/workscope/source\nTarget: /Users/dev/workscope-dev\n\nPre-scanning source...\n\nERROR: Suspicious file detected: source/__pycache__/\nDevelopment artifacts should not exist in source/.\nPlease investigate (possible Rule 6.1 violation) and clean before staging.\n```\n\n**Analysis**: The script detected a `__pycache__/` directory during pre-scan (before modifying the target). The target directory remains unchanged. The developer must investigate and remove the artifact before staging can proceed.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Release Managers\n\n1. **Always verify git status after staging**: Run `cd ../workscope-dev && git status` to see exactly what changed before committing.\n\n2. **Review diff for unexpected changes**: Run `git diff` in the staging directory to verify no unintended modifications.\n\n3. **Test dry-run first for major releases**: Use `--dry-run` to preview the staging operation, especially after significant changes to `source/`.\n\n4. **Maintain clean source directory**: Ensure `source/` remains free of development artifacts per Design Decision 9.\n\n### For Developers\n\n1. **Use proper development environment**: Run WSD from the development root, not from within `source/`, to avoid creating artifacts.\n\n2. **Keep .wsdignore minimal**: Only add files that genuinely need to exist in `source/` for development purposes.\n\n3. **Address errors immediately**: If the script halts on a suspicious file, investigate the root cause rather than working around it.\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **Pre-Staging-Script-Overview.md**: Describes the pre-staging script that must run before staging to prepare wsd.json with hashes, executable list, and version\n- **Build-System-Overview.md**: Describes PyPI packaging that consumes the staged output; the staging script is a prerequisite to the build process\n- **Design-Decisions.md § Decision 9**: Establishes the principle of keeping WSD Runtime directory pure and ship-ready, which this script enforces\n- **Install-And-Update-Overview.md**: Describes installation behavior that the staged files will exhibit when distributed\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm and format specification\n- **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**: Schema for wsd.json including file_hashes field\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the Stage Release Script including the staging algorithm, exclusion patterns, directory management, verification procedures, and error handling.

These files are excluded from the copy operation during installation. The list of excluded files includes wsd.json (WSD Runtime metadata) and potentially other installation-only files.

If the target directory already contains user files (from a pre-existing project), Stage 2 correctly skips .wsdkeep creation because the directory doesn't need a placeholder.\n   729→\n   730→**Key Distinction**: The `required_directories` field in wsd.json declares semantic intent (\"these directories must exist\"), not file-level tracking. .wsdkeep files are generated at installation time based on directory state, not copied from the source.\n   731→\n   732→### Manifest Exclusion\n   733→\n   734→.wsdkeep files are **never recorded in the manifest**.

ALL errors are fatal and halt the operation immediately.\n   874→\n   875→**Error Types That Trigger Halt and Rollback:**\n   876→- Read errors (PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError, OSError) when reading source files\n   877→- Write errors (PermissionError, disk full, etc.) when copying files\n   878→- Tag parsing errors (malformed tags, invalid tag IDs, missing closing tags)\n   879→- Any other exception during file processing\n   880→\n   881→There is no distinction between \"fatal\" and \"non-fatal\" errors. All errors halt the operation and trigger rollback.\n   882→\n   883→**Implementation**:\n   884→1. Perform all validation checks first\n   885→2. Only begin file copying after all checks pass\n   886→3. If ANY error occurs during operations, halt immediately and trigger automatic rollback\n   887→4. Rollback removes all partial files and directories\n   888→5. Do not create .wsd manifest if installation incomplete\n   889→\n   890→### Rollback Mechanism\n   891→\n   892→The installation system implements automatic rollback to ensure atomic operation guarantees. When ANY error occurs during installation (read error, write error, tag parsing error, or any exception), all partial work is cleaned up automatically. All errors are fatal—there is no continuation on errors.\n   893→\n   894→**Automatic Rollback**:\n   895→\n   896→When installation fails during file copy operations, the system automatically performs rollback cleanup to restore the target directory to its pre-installation state:\n   897→\n   898→1. **File Cleanup**: All successfully copied files are deleted in reverse order\n   899→2. **Directory Cleanup**: Empty directories created during installation are removed (bottom-up)\n   900→3. **Pre-Existing Preservation**: Directories containing pre-existing files are preserved\n   901→4. **Status Reporting**: Rollback results reported to user via stderr\n   902→\n   903→**Rollback Success Output**:\n   904→```\n   905→Rollback: Removed 47 partial installation files, 12 empty directories\n   906→```\n   907→\n   908→**Partial Rollback Output** (when some files cannot be deleted):\n   909→```\n   910→Rollback: Removed 45 of 47 partial files\n   911→Removed 10 empty directories\n   912→\n   913→Warning: Could not remove the following files:\n   914→  - /path/to/target/docs/core/Action-Plan.md: Permission denied\n   915→  - /path/to/target/scripts/health_check.py: File in use\n   916→\n   917→Manual cleanup required for files listed above before retrying installation.\n   918→```\n   919→\n   920→**Interrupted Installation Handling**:\n   921→\n   922→If installation is interrupted by external events (crash, kill signal, network failure) before rollback can execute, partial files may remain in the target directory.

It provides a robust mechanism for copying WSD Runtime files from the WSD Runtime root directory to a target project directory, while detecting and preventing file collisions, managing empty directory structures, creating tracking manifests, and preserving file permissions.\n\nThis specification defines the complete installation process for both fresh installations (into new or empty directories) and integration installations (into existing projects with potential file conflicts).\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Installation System integrates with other WSD components, see System-Architecture.md.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Installation System serves four critical functions:\n\n1. **Safe Deployment**: Copies WSD Runtime templates to target projects without overwriting existing files\n2. **Collision Detection**: Identifies and reports conflicts before any files are modified\n3. **Structure Management**: Creates necessary directory hierarchies and maintains empty directories via .wsdkeep files\n4. **Tracking Initialization**: Creates the .wsd manifest file that enables future updates\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of installation procedures, collision detection algorithms, manifest creation, and error handling.\n\n## Installation Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Target Directory Does Not Exist\n\n**Context**: Installing WSD when the target path doesn't exist yet.\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/new-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory does not exist\n- User has write permissions to parent directory\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Create target directory\n2. Verify no .wsd manifest exists (guaranteed - directory just created)\n3. Copy all files from WSD Runtime root to target directory (excluding wsd.json)\n4. Set execute permissions on script files\n5. Create .wsd manifest file\n6. Report success\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- Target directory created\n- All template files copied\n- Directory structure established with .wsdkeep files\n- Execute permissions set on scripts\n- .wsd manifest created\n- Installation completes successfully\n\n### Scenario 2: Target Directory Exists and Is Empty\n\n**Context**: Installing WSD into an existing but empty directory (may contain non-WSD files like .git).\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/existing-empty-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory exists\n- No .wsd manifest exists\n- No files conflict with WSD template files\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Verify no .wsd manifest exists\n2. Perform collision detection (finds no conflicts)\n3. Copy all files from WSD Runtime root to target directory (excluding wsd.json)\n4. Set execute permissions on script files\n5. Create .wsd manifest file\n6. Report success\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- All template files copied\n- Any existing non-WSD files remain untouched\n- WSD structure integrates alongside existing files\n- Installation completes successfully\n\n### Scenario 3: Target Directory Has File Conflicts\n\n**Context**: Installing WSD into a directory containing files that would be overwritten by WSD templates.\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/existing-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory exists\n- No .wsd manifest exists (not a WSD-managed project)\n- One or more files conflict with WSD template files\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Verify no .wsd manifest exists\n2. Perform collision detection\n3. Detect conflicts (e.g., existing README.md, scripts/health_check.py)\n4. **HALT**: Report all collisions to user\n5. Exit with error code\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- No files copied or modified\n- Clear error message listing all collisions\n- User must resolve conflicts before installation\n- Installation aborted (atomic operation)\n\n**Example Error Output**:\n```\nError: Installation aborted due to file collisions.\n\nThe following files exist with different content:\n  - README.md (content differs from WSD template)\n  - scripts/health_check.py (content differs from WSD template)\n  - docs/core/Action-Plan.md (content differs from WSD template)\n\nPlease resolve these conflicts before installing WSD:\n  1. Rename or move existing files\n  2. Delete files if they can be replaced by WSD templates\n  3. Use --force to overwrite all conflicting files\n\nAfter resolving conflicts, retry: wsd.py install /path/to/existing-project\n```\n\n### Scenario 4: WSD Already Installed (Update Needed)\n\n**Context**: Attempting fresh installation when .wsd manifest already exists.\n\n**User Command**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install /path/to/wsd-project\n```\n\n**Preconditions**:\n- Target directory exists\n- .wsd manifest file exists (indicates previous WSD installation)\n\n**Process Flow**:\n1. Detect existing .wsd manifest\n2. **HALT**: Redirect to update mechanism\n3. Exit with informative message\n\n**Expected Outcome**:\n- No files modified\n- Clear message indicating WSD already installed\n- User directed to use update command instead\n- Installation aborted\n\n**Example Output**:\n```\nError: WSD already installed in this directory.\n\nFound existing .wsd manifest.\n\nTo update your WSD installation, use:\n  wsd.py update /path/to/wsd-project\n\nTo force a fresh installation (WARNING: will overwrite all WSD files):\n  wsd.py install --force /path/to/wsd-project\n```\n\n## Idempotent Installation\n\n### Overview\n\nThe WSD Installation System implements idempotent behavior, meaning that running the install command multiple times produces the same result as running it once. This is achieved through content hash comparison during the installation process.\n\nWhen files already exist in the target directory with content identical to the WSD template files, the installation system skips copying those files. This provides several benefits:\n\n1. **Efficiency**: No unnecessary file I/O operations when content already matches\n2. **Safety**: File modification timestamps are preserved for unchanged files\n3. **Self-Healing**: Incomplete installations are automatically completed on subsequent install attempts\n4. **Determinism**: The same operation always produces the same result\n\n### Behavior\n\nDuring installation, the collision detection algorithm categorizes existing files into two groups:\n\n**True Collisions**: Files that exist with different content than the WSD template. These block installation unless `--force` is specified.\n\n**False Positives**: Files that exist with identical content to the WSD template. These are automatically skipped during the file copy phase but are still included in the manifest.\n\nFor files categorized as false positives:\n- The file copy operation is skipped (no I/O performed)\n- The file is added to the manifest's `files` array\n- Executable permissions are still applied if the file is in the executable list\n- Tag scanning still occurs for manifest creation\n\n### User Communication\n\nWhen false positives are detected, the system informs the user:\n\n```\nFound 3 existing file(s) with identical content (will skip copying):\n  - .claude/agents/task-master.md\n  - scripts/health_check.py\n  - docs/read-only/Agent-System.md\n\nProceeding with installation...\n```\n\n### Self-Healing Behavior\n\nIf an installation is interrupted (e.g., by power loss, process termination, or network failure), the incomplete state is automatically repaired on the next installation attempt:\n\n1. Files that were successfully copied remain in place (content matches)\n2. Files not yet copied are detected as missing and copied normally\n3. The manifest is created or updated to reflect the complete installation\n\nThis eliminates the need for manual recovery procedures in most interruption scenarios.\n\n## Collision Detection Algorithm\n\n### Overview\n\nThe collision detection algorithm identifies any files in the target directory that would be overwritten by WSD template files. This check occurs BEFORE any files are copied, ensuring atomic installation operations. The algorithm uses content hash comparison to distinguish between true collisions (different content) and false positives (identical content). Files with identical content are not reported as collisions. For hash calculation algorithm and comparison logic, see **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n### Algorithm Specification\n\n```python\ndef detect_collisions(source_dir, target_dir):\n    \"\"\"\n    Detect file collisions between source templates and target directory.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to WSD Runtime root directory\n        target_dir: Path to target installation directory (user's project)\n\n    Returns:\n        list: List of relative paths that would collide (empty if no collisions)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Get list of all files to be installed\n    source_files = get_all_files(source_dir)\n    # Example: ['.claude/agents/task-master.md', 'README.md', 'scripts/health_check.py']\n\n    # Step 2: Initialize collision list\n    collisions = []\n\n    # Step 3: Check each source file against target\n    for relative_path in source_files:\n        target_path = os.path.join(target_dir, relative_path)\n\n        # Check if file exists in target\n        if os.path.exists(target_path):\n            collisions.append(relative_path)\n\n    # Step 4: Return collision list\n    return collisions\n\n\ndef get_all_files(directory):\n    \"\"\"\n    Recursively get all files in directory as relative paths.\n\n    Automatically excludes files inside VCS directories (.git/, .svn/, etc.).\n\n    Args:\n        directory: Root directory to scan\n\n    Returns:\n        list: Relative paths of all files (not directories, not VCS internals)\n    \"\"\"\n    files = []\n\n    for root, dirs, filenames in os.walk(directory):\n        for filename in filenames:\n            # Get full path\n            full_path = os.path.join(root, filename)\n\n            # Convert to relative path from directory\n            relative_path = os.path.relpath(full_path, directory)\n\n            # Skip files inside VCS directories\n            if any(vcs in relative_path.split(os.sep) for vcs in VCS_DIRECTORIES):\n                continue\n\n            files.append(relative_path)\n\n    return files\n```\n\n### Collision Detection Rules\n\n1. **File-Level Only**: Only files are checked, not directories\n2. **Recursive Scan**: All subdirectories are scanned\n3. **Relative Paths**: Paths stored relative to project root\n4. **Case Sensitive**: Filenames matched exactly as they appear\n5. **Symlinks Followed**: Symlinks to files are treated as files\n6. **Hidden Files Included**: Files starting with `.` are checked\n7. **VCS Directories Excluded**: Files inside `.git/`, `.svn/`, `.hg/`, `.bzr/`, and `CVS/` are automatically excluded\n\n### Special Cases\n\n#### .wsdkeep Files\n**Behavior**: .wsdkeep files never cause collisions\n**Rationale**: These are placeholder files that can be overwritten freely\n**Detection**: Skip collision check for any file named `.wsdkeep`\n\n#### .wsd Manifest\n**Behavior**: Existence of .wsd indicates update scenario, not fresh installation\n**Detection**: If .wsd exists, installation process should defer to update process\n**Error**: \"WSD already installed. Use update mechanism instead.\"\n\n#### .gitignore File\n**Behavior**: Collision with .gitignore is reported normally\n**Rationale**: User may have custom gitignore rules\n**User Action**: User must merge WSD's .gitignore with their own\n\n#### Directories Without Files\n**Behavior**: Empty directories don't cause collisions\n**Rationale**: Directories are created as needed during file copying\n**Example**: Existing empty `docs/` directory is not a collision\n\n### Collision Detection Examples\n\n#### Example 1: No Collisions\n\n**Target Directory Contents**:\n```\ntarget/\n├── .git/           # User's version control\n├── src/            # User's source code\n└── package.json    # User's config\n```\n\n**WSD Runtime Files (subset)**:\n```\n<wsd-runtime>/               # WSD Runtime distribution\n├── .git/                   # EXCLUDED - VCS directory (if present)\n├── .claude/\n├── docs/\n├── scripts/\n├── wsd.py\n├── wsd.json                # NOT copied during installation\n└── README.md\n```\n\n**Collision Check Result**:\n```python\ncollisions = []  # Empty list\n# Verdict: Safe to proceed with installation\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Single Collision\n\n**Target Directory Contents**:\n```\ntarget/\n├── .git/\n├── src/\n├── package.json\n└── README.md       # COLLISION: WSD has README.md template\n```\n\n**Collision Check Result**:\n```python\ncollisions = ['README.md']\n# Verdict: Installation aborted\n```\n\n#### Example 3: Multiple Collisions\n\n**Target Directory Contents**:\n```\ntarget/\n├── .git/\n├── README.md              # COLLISION\n├── scripts/\n│   └── health_check.py    # COLLISION\n└── docs/\n    └── core/\n        └── Action-Plan.md # COLLISION\n```\n\n**Collision Check Result**:\n```python\ncollisions = [\n    'README.md',\n    'scripts/health_check.py',\n    'docs/core/Action-Plan.md'\n]\n# Verdict: Installation aborted with detailed report\n```\n\n#### Example 4: .wsdkeep False Collision\n\n**Target Directory Contents**:\n```\ntarget/\n├── docs/\n│   └── workbench/\n│       └── .wsdkeep    # NOT a collision\n└── dev/\n    └── diagnostics/\n        └── .wsdkeep    # NOT a collision\n```\n\n**Collision Check Result**:\n```python\ncollisions = []  # .wsdkeep files ignored\n# Verdict: Safe to proceed\n```\n\n## File Copying Process\n\n### Overview\n\nAfter collision detection passes, the installation process copies all WSD Runtime files from the WSD Runtime root directory to the target directory, creating necessary directory structures and setting appropriate permissions.\n\n**Installation File Exclusion:** Certain files are required for installation operations but not for WSD Runtime operation in the destination project. These files are excluded from the copy operation during installation. The list of excluded files includes wsd.json (WSD Runtime metadata) and potentially other installation-only files. For complete wsd.json specification including JSON schema, policy behavior, and Source of Truth role, see **Template-System.md § WSD Runtime Metadata**.\n\n**Side Effect - Installation Source Restriction:** Because installation-only files are not copied to the destination, WSD-integrated projects cannot themselves serve as installation sources for new projects. Only the original WSD Runtime distribution (which contains all installation files) can be used to install WSD into new projects. This is a natural consequence of the exclusion design, not its primary purpose.\n\n### Copying Algorithm\n\n```python\ndef install_files(source_dir, target_dir, executable_files):\n    \"\"\"\n    Copy all files from source to target, creating directories as needed.\n\n    Args:\n        source_dir: Path to WSD Runtime root directory\n        target_dir: Path to target installation directory\n        executable_files: List of files requiring executable permission (from wsd.json)\n\n    Returns:\n        list: Relative paths of all installed files\n    \"\"\"\n\n    installed_files = []\n\n    # Step 1: Get all files to install\n    source_files = get_all_files(source_dir)\n\n    # Step 2: Copy each file\n    for relative_path in source_files:\n        source_path = os.path.join(source_dir, relative_path)\n        target_path = os.path.join(target_dir, relative_path)\n\n        # Create parent directory if needed\n        target_parent = os.path.dirname(target_path)\n        os.makedirs(target_parent, exist_ok=True)\n\n        # Copy file (preserves source file permissions)\n        shutil.copy2(source_path, target_path)\n\n        installed_files.append(relative_path)\n\n    # Step 3: Set executable permissions on designated files\n    for relative_path in executable_files:\n        if relative_path in installed_files:\n            target_path = os.path.join(target_dir, relative_path)\n            set_executable(target_path)\n\n    return installed_files\n\n\ndef set_executable(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Set executable permission bit on file.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path: Path to file\n    \"\"\"\n    current_permissions = os.stat(file_path).st_mode\n    os.chmod(file_path, current_permissions | 0o111)  # Add execute for user/group/other\n```\n\n### Directory Creation Rules\n\n1. **On-Demand Creation**: Directories created only when needed for file\n2. **Parent Hierarchies**: All parent directories created if missing\n3. **Existing Directories**: No error if directory already exists\n4. **Permissions**: Directories created with standard permissions (755)\n\n### File Permission Handling\n\nFor complete file permission model including declaration rationale and conservative approach, see **Template-System.md § File Permission Model**.\n\n#### Installation Implementation\n\n**Standard Files**:\n- Copied with source permissions via `shutil.copy2()`\n- Preserves original file permissions from template\n\n**Executable Files**:\n- After all files copied, read executable array from wsd.json\n- Apply +x bit to each file in executable list\n- Use conservative approach (only add +x, don't modify other bits)\n\n**Permission Setting**:\n```python\ndef set_executable(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Add executable permission to file.\"\"\"\n    current_mode = os.stat(file_path).st_mode\n    os.chmod(file_path, current_mode | 0o111)  # Add +x for user/group/other\n```\n\n### Special File Handling\n\n#### .wsdkeep Files\n**Purpose**: Maintain empty directory structure\n**Creation**: Automatically created during installation\n**Content**: Always empty (0 bytes)\n**Locations**: Any directory intended to start empty\n\n**Example Locations**:\nEmpty directories throughout the WSD structure contain .wsdkeep files, including archive directories, working directories, and organizational subdirectories. The specific locations are determined by the template structure definition.\n\n#### no_overwrite Files\n\nFiles declared in the no_overwrite array are protected from being overwritten during updates. For complete no_overwrite policy specification including purpose, behavior, and design rationale, see **Template-System.md § File Protection: no_overwrite Policy**.\n\n**Installation Behavior**:\n- Initial Installation: Protected files copied normally from template\n- Future Updates: If file exists, skip updating it (preservation happens in update process)\n\n#### VCS Directory Exclusion\n\nVersion control system directories are automatically excluded from installation operations. These directories contain repository metadata that is specific to the source distribution and should never be copied to target projects.\n\n**Excluded VCS Directories:**\n- `.git/` - Git\n- `.svn/` - Subversion\n- `.hg/` - Mercurial\n- `.bzr/` - Bazaar\n- `CVS/` - CVS\n\n**Behavior:**\n- Files inside VCS directories are never scanned, copied, or included in manifests\n- Exclusion is automatic and requires no user configuration\n- This exclusion is distinct from `installation_only` configuration - VCS exclusion is hardcoded, not user-configurable\n- Files with names containing VCS directory names (e.g., `.gitignore`, `my.git-notes.txt`) are NOT excluded - only files actually inside VCS directories are filtered\n\n**Rationale:**\n- VCS directories contain repository-specific metadata (commit history, hooks, configuration)\n- Copying VCS internals would pollute the target project with irrelevant files\n- Target projects typically have their own version control configuration\n- This matches industry-standard behavior for distribution and installation tools\n\n**Example:**\nWhen installing from a WSD Runtime that is itself a git repository:\n\n```\nwsd-runtime/                    # Source directory (git repo)\n├── .git/                       # EXCLUDED - VCS directory\n│   ├── config                  # Not copied\n│   ├── HEAD                    # Not copied\n│   └── hooks/                  # Not copied\n├── .gitignore                  # INCLUDED - not inside .git/\n├── wsd.py                      # INCLUDED\n└── scripts/\n    └── health_check.py         # INCLUDED\n```\n\nThe resulting installation contains only the actual WSD files, with no `.git/` internals in the manifest or target directory.\n\n## WSD Runtime Metadata (wsd.json)\n\nThe WSD Runtime includes a metadata file that declares version information, file protection policies, and executable file lists.\n\n**Key Points**:\n- Located at WSD Runtime root (e.g., `wsd-runtime/wsd.json`)\n- NOT copied during installation (prevents propagation issues)\n- Contains version, no_overwrite array, and executable array\n- Serves as Source of Truth for policies during operations\n\n**Usage in Installation**:\n1. Read wsd.json from source directory\n2. Extract version for manifest creation\n3. Extract no_overwrite policies for update operations\n4. Extract executable list for permission setting\n\n**Example**:\n```python\ndef install_wsd(source_dir, target_dir):\n    \"\"\"Install WSD Runtime into target directory.\"\"\"\n    # Read WSD metadata\n    wsd_metadata = read_wsd_metadata(source_dir)\n\n    # Extract fields\n    wsd_version = wsd_metadata['version']\n    no_overwrite_files = wsd_metadata.get('no_overwrite', [])\n    executable_files = wsd_metadata.get('executable', [])\n\n    # Use in installation process\n    # ...\n```\n\nFor complete wsd.json specification including JSON schema, field semantics, policy behavior, installation exclusion rule, Source of Truth role, validation rules, and comprehensive examples, see **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**.\n\n## .wsd Manifest Creation\n\n### Overview\n\nThe .wsd manifest file is created at the root of the target directory after all files are successfully copied. It serves as the authoritative record of WSD installation and enables future update operations.\n\n### Manifest Specification\n\nFor complete .wsd manifest specification including JSON schema, field semantics, derived data model, validation rules, and examples, see **WSD-Manifest-Schema.md**.\n\n### Manifest Creation Algorithm\n\n```python\ndef create_manifest(target_dir, file_paths, wsd_version):\n    \"\"\"\n    Create .wsd manifest file after successful installation.\n\n    Args:\n        target_dir: Path to installation target directory\n        file_paths: List of relative paths for installed files\n        wsd_version: WSD version from wsd.json\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Path to created manifest file\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Create base manifest structure\n    manifest = {\n        'version': wsd_version,\n        'created': get_iso_timestamp(),\n        'updated': get_iso_timestamp(),\n        'files': file_paths,  # Simple array of paths\n        'tags': []\n    }\n\n    # Step 2: Scan all files for WORKSCOPE-DEV tags\n    for relative_path in file_paths:\n        file_path = os.path.join(target_dir, relative_path)\n        tags_in_file = scan_for_tags(file_path)\n\n        for tag_id in tags_in_file:\n            manifest['tags'].append({\n                'id': tag_id,\n                'file': relative_path\n            })\n\n    # Step 3: Write manifest to .wsd file\n    manifest_path = os.path.join(target_dir, '.wsd')\n    with open(manifest_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n        json.dump(manifest, f, indent=4, ensure_ascii=False)\n\n    return manifest_path\n\n\ndef scan_for_tags(file_path):\n    \"\"\"\n    Scan file for WORKSCOPE-DEV tags.\n\n    Args:\n        file_path: Path to file to scan\n\n    Returns:\n        list: List of tag IDs found in file\n    \"\"\"\n\n    tags = []\n\n    try:\n        with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n            for line in f:\n                # Look for opening tag: <WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-id>\n                if '<WORKSCOPE-DEV ' in line:\n                    # Extract tag ID\n                    tag_id = extract_tag_id(line)\n                    if tag_id:\n                        tags.append(tag_id)\n    except (UnicodeDecodeError, IOError):\n        # Skip binary files or files we can't read\n        pass\n\n    return tags\n\n\ndef extract_tag_id(line):\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract tag ID from line containing opening tag.\n\n    Args:\n        line: Text line containing <WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-id>\n\n    Returns:\n        str: Tag ID or None if not found\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Simple string extraction\n    start = line.find('<WORKSCOPE-DEV ') + len('<WORKSCOPE-DEV ')\n    end = line.find('>', start)\n\n    if start > len('<WORKSCOPE-DEV ') - 1 and end > start:\n        return line[start:end].strip()\n\n    return None\n```\n\n\n## Required Directory Processing During Installation\n\nFor complete .wsdkeep specification including purpose, lifecycle, version control integration, and design philosophy, see **Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files**.\n\n### Two-Stage Processing\n\nInstallation uses a **two-stage approach** to ensure directories are created and .wsdkeep files are added based on the final directory state:\n\n**Stage 1: Regular Files**\nAll content files (excluding .wsdkeep) are copied first. This establishes the actual content state of all directories before structural decisions are made. Regular files create their parent directories as needed during copying.\n\n**Stage 2: Required Directories**\nAfter all regular files are copied, the `required_directories` array from wsd.json is processed. For each directory path in the array:\n\n1. **Ensure directory exists**: Create the directory if it doesn't exist\n2. **Evaluate directory state**: Apply `_directory_needs_wsdkeep()` logic against final directory state\n3. **Create .wsdkeep if needed**: Add .wsdkeep only if directory is empty\n\n```\nDecision Logic (_directory_needs_wsdkeep):\n- If directory does NOT exist → Create directory + .wsdkeep\n- If directory exists but is empty → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n- If directory contains only .wsdkeep → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n- If directory has other content → Skip .wsdkeep (content maintains structure)\n```\n\n**Why Two Stages**: Processing `required_directories` after regular file operations ensures correct decisions based on the final directory state. If the target directory already contains user files (from a pre-existing project), Stage 2 correctly skips .wsdkeep creation because the directory doesn't need a placeholder.\n\n**Key Distinction**: The `required_directories` field in wsd.json declares semantic intent (\"these directories must exist\"), not file-level tracking. .wsdkeep files are generated at installation time based on directory state, not copied from the source.\n\n### Manifest Exclusion\n\n.wsdkeep files are **never recorded in the manifest**. The manifest tracks content files only. Directory requirements are declarative (via `required_directories` in wsd.json) rather than tracked file-by-file.\n\n### Collision Handling\n\n.wsdkeep files are explicitly excluded from collision detection. They never trigger collision warnings. See Collision Detection Algorithm section for details.\n\n### Directory Creation\n\n- Directories are created on-demand when copying regular files (Stage 1)\n- Required directories are ensured via `required_directories` processing (Stage 2)\n- .wsdkeep files are created only in empty directories\n- Final structure matches WSD Runtime layout with .wsdkeep present only where needed\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Permission Errors\n\n**Error**: Cannot create target directory\n```\nError: Permission denied creating directory '/path/to/target'\n\nCheck that you have write permissions to the parent directory.\n```\n\n**Error**: Cannot write to target directory\n```\nError: Permission denied writing to '/path/to/target'\n\nCheck that you have write permissions to this directory.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: User must adjust permissions or choose different target\n\n#### 2. Collision Errors\n\n**Error**: Files already exist\n```\nError: Installation aborted due to file collisions.\n\nThe following files already exist in the target directory:\n  - README.md\n  - scripts/health_check.py\n\nPlease resolve these conflicts before installing WSD.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: User must rename/move/delete conflicting files\n\n#### 3. Installation Rollback Errors\n\n**Error**: Permission denied during file copy with automatic rollback\n```\n\nRollback: Removed 47 partial installation files, 12 empty directories\n\nError: Permission denied writing to '/path/to/target/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md'\n\nCheck that you have write permissions to this directory.\n```\n\n**Error**: Disk full during installation with automatic rollback\n```\n\nRollback: Removed 23 partial installation files, 5 empty directories\n\nError: Insufficient disk space during installation\n\nRan out of disk space while copying 'scripts/health_check.py'\n\n  1. Free up disk space\n  2. Retry installation\n```\n\n**Error**: Partial rollback when some files cannot be deleted\n```\n\nRollback: Removed 45 of 47 partial files\nRemoved 10 empty directories\n\nWarning: Could not remove the following files:\n  - /path/to/target/docs/core/Action-Plan.md: Permission denied\n  - /path/to/target/scripts/health_check.py: File in use\n\nManual cleanup required for files listed above before retrying installation.\n\nError: Permission denied writing to '/path/to/target/.claude/agents/task-master.md'\n\nCheck that you have write permissions to this directory.\n```\n\n**Recovery**: The automatic rollback mechanism attempts to remove all partially installed files and empty directories. If rollback succeeds completely, users can retry immediately. If rollback is partial, users must manually clean up the listed files before retry.\n\n#### 4. Filesystem Errors\n\n**Error**: Target path is a file\n```\nError: Target path '/path/to/target' is a file, not a directory.\n\nSpecify a directory path for installation.\n```\n\n**Error**: Source directory not found\n```\nError: WSD source directory not found.\n\nThis appears to be a packaging issue. Please reinstall WSD.\n```\n\n**Error**: Disk space insufficient\n```\nError: Insufficient disk space for installation.\n\nRequired: 50 MB\nAvailable: 10 MB\n\nFree up disk space and retry.\n```\n\n#### 4. Manifest Errors\n\n**Error**: Cannot write manifest\n```\nError: Failed to create .wsd manifest file.\n\nThis may indicate a permission or disk space issue.\n```\n\n**Error**: WSD already installed\n```\nError: WSD already installed in this directory.\n\nFound existing .wsd manifest. Use update mechanism instead:\n  wsd.py update /path/to/target\n```\n\n### Atomic Operation Guarantee\n\n**Principle (Per Design Decision 12)**: Installation is all-or-nothing. ALL errors are fatal and halt the operation immediately.\n\n**Error Types That Trigger Halt and Rollback:**\n- Read errors (PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError, OSError) when reading source files\n- Write errors (PermissionError, disk full, etc.) when copying files\n- Tag parsing errors (malformed tags, invalid tag IDs, missing closing tags)\n- Any other exception during file processing\n\nThere is no distinction between \"fatal\" and \"non-fatal\" errors. All errors halt the operation and trigger rollback.\n\n**Implementation**:\n1. Perform all validation checks first\n2. Only begin file copying after all checks pass\n3. If ANY error occurs during operations, halt immediately and trigger automatic rollback\n4. Rollback removes all partial files and directories\n5. Do not create .wsd manifest if installation incomplete\n\n### Rollback Mechanism\n\nThe installation system implements automatic rollback to ensure atomic operation guarantees. When ANY error occurs during installation (read error, write error, tag parsing error, or any exception), all partial work is cleaned up automatically. All errors are fatal—there is no continuation on errors.\n\n**Automatic Rollback**:\n\nWhen installation fails during file copy operations, the system automatically performs rollback cleanup to restore the target directory to its pre-installation state:\n\n1. **File Cleanup**: All successfully copied files are deleted in reverse order\n2. **Directory Cleanup**: Empty directories created during installation are removed (bottom-up)\n3. **Pre-Existing Preservation**: Directories containing pre-existing files are preserved\n4. **Status Reporting**: Rollback results reported to user via stderr\n\n**Rollback Success Output**:\n```\nRollback: Removed 47 partial installation files, 12 empty directories\n```\n\n**Partial Rollback Output** (when some files cannot be deleted):\n```\nRollback: Removed 45 of 47 partial files\nRemoved 10 empty directories\n\nWarning: Could not remove the following files:\n  - /path/to/target/docs/core/Action-Plan.md: Permission denied\n  - /path/to/target/scripts/health_check.py: File in use\n\nManual cleanup required for files listed above before retrying installation.\n```\n\n**Interrupted Installation Handling**:\n\nIf installation is interrupted by external events (crash, kill signal, network failure) before rollback can execute, partial files may remain in the target directory. The system guarantees no .wsd manifest will exist for incomplete installations.\n\n**Manual Cleanup Procedures**:\n\nIf automatic rollback cannot remove all files, or if installation was interrupted before rollback could execute, users have three options:\n\n**Option 1: Version Control Restoration (Recommended)**\n```bash\n# If target directory is under version control\ncd /path/to/target\ngit status  # Review partially installed files\ngit clean -fd  # Remove untracked files (WSD installation files)\ngit checkout .  # Restore any modified files\n# Retry installation\nwsd.py install /path/to/target\n```\n\n**Option 2: Manual Selective Removal**\n```bash\n# Remove specific WSD directories and files\nrm -rf /path/to/target/.claude\nrm -rf /path/to/target/docs\nrm -rf /path/to/target/scripts\nrm -rf /path/to/target/dev\nrm /path/to/target/wsd.py\n# Retry installation\nwsd.py install /path/to/target\n```\n\n**Option 3: Fresh Start**\n```bash\n# Remove target directory entirely and start over\nrm -rf /path/to/target\nmkdir /path/to/target\n# Install WSD\nwsd.py install /path/to/target\n```\n\n**Recommendations**:\n- Always use version control to track installation state\n- Commit before attempting installation\n- If interruption occurs, use `git status` to see what was partially installed\n- Use `git clean -fd` to remove all untracked files from failed installation\n- Use `--force` flag to overwrite conflicting files during installation\n\n### Error Reporting Format\n\n**Structure**:\n```\nError: <Brief error description>\n\n<Detailed explanation>\n\n<Actionable steps to resolve>\n\n<Command to retry (if applicable)>\n```\n\n**Example**:\n```\nError: Installation aborted due to file collisions.\n\nThe target directory already contains files that would be\noverwritten by WSD templates:\n  - README.md (244 bytes)\n  - scripts/health_check.py (1.2 KB)\n\nTo proceed with installation, you must:\n  1. Back up any important content from these files\n  2. Rename or remove the conflicting files\n  3. Retry the installation\n\nAfter resolving conflicts:\n  wsd.py install /path/to/target\n```\n\n## Integration Examples\n\nThese examples demonstrate WSD installation in various real-world contexts. The examples are illustrative - actual project structures will vary.\n\n### Example 1: New Project with Version Control\n\n**User Context**: Starting a new project with WSD and git from the beginning.\n\n**Steps**:\n```bash\n# Create project directory\nmkdir my-new-project\n\n# Install WSD\nwsd.py install my-new-project\n\n# Navigate to project\ncd my-new-project\n\n# Initialize git\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit with WSD\"\n```\n\n**Result**: Complete WSD structure ready to use, tracked in git.\n\n### Example 2: Existing Project Without Conflicts\n\n**User Context**: Adding WSD to an existing project that doesn't have conflicting files.\n\n**Illustrative Initial State**:\n```\nmy-project/\n├── .git/\n├── src/\n│   └── main.py\n├── tests/\n│   └── test_main.py\n└── requirements.txt\n```\n\n**Installation**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install my-project\n# Success! (no collisions)\n```\n\n**Result**: WSD structure integrates alongside existing project structure. Existing files remain untouched, WSD directories (.claude/, dev/, docs/, scripts/) added.\n\n### Example 3: Collision Resolution Workflow\n\n**User Context**: Existing project has file that conflicts with WSD template.\n\n**Attempt Installation**:\n```bash\nwsd.py install my-project\n# Error: Installation aborted due to file collisions.\n# The following files already exist: README.md\n```\n\n**Resolution Options**:\n\n**Option A: Preserve Existing Content**\n```bash\n# Backup existing file\nmv README.md README-original.md\n\n# Install WSD\nwsd.py install my-project\n\n# Merge content as appropriate\n# (manual integration of both files)\n```\n\n**Option B: Replace with Template**\n```bash\n# Remove conflicting file\nrm README.md\n\n# Install WSD\nwsd.py install my-project\n```\n\n**Result**: After resolving conflicts, installation proceeds successfully.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Users Installing WSD\n\n1. **Use Version Control**: Always install WSD in a git-tracked directory\n2. **Commit Before Install**: Create checkpoint before installation\n3. **Review Installation**: Check installed files after completion\n4. **Customize Immediately**: Fill in WORKSCOPE-DEV tags while fresh\n5. **Commit After Install**: Create commit with clear message\n\n**Recommended Installation Flow**:\n```bash\n# 1. Create/navigate to project\ncd my-project\n\n# 2. Initialize git if needed\ngit init\n\n# 3. Commit existing work\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Before WSD installation\"\n\n# 4. Install WSD\nwsd.py install .\n\n# 5. Review changes\ngit status\ngit diff\n\n# 6. Customize tagged sections\n# (edit files with WORKSCOPE-DEV tags)\n\n# 7. Commit WSD\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Add Workscope-Dev framework\"\n```\n\n### For WSD Template Designers\n\n1. **Minimize Collisions**: Choose file names unlikely to conflict\n2. **Document Conflicts**: Clearly document any expected collision scenarios\n3. **Provide Alternatives**: Offer guidance for resolving common collisions\n4. **Use .wsdkeep**: Mark all initially-empty directories\n5. **Test Integration**: Test installation in various project types\n\n### For WSD Implementation\n\n1. **Clear Error Messages**: Make collision errors actionable\n2. **Atomic Operations**: Never leave partial installations\n3. **Preserve Metadata**: Keep file timestamps and permissions\n4. **Log Operations**: Provide verbose mode (`--verbose` / `-v`) for debugging\n5. **Validate Thoroughly**: Check all preconditions before modifying files\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### Performance Requirements\n\n1. **Collision Detection**: O(n) where n = number of template files\n2. **File Copying**: Sequential copy operations\n3. **Manifest Creation**: Single file write after all copies complete\n4. **Tag Scanning**: O(m × l) where m = number of files, l = average file lines\n\n**Expected Performance**:\nPerformance scales with the number and size of template files. Installation involves file system operations (copying, checksumming, directory creation) that are I/O bound. Typical installations complete in seconds.\n\n### Platform Requirements\n\n1. **Python Version**: Python 3.10+\n2. **Filesystem**: POSIX-compliant (Linux, macOS, WSL)\n3. **Permissions**: Standard Unix permissions (644/755)\n4. **Path Length**: Support paths up to 4096 characters\n\n### Dependencies\n\n**Standard Library Only**:\n- `os`, `os.path` - Path operations\n- `shutil` - File copying\n- `json` - Manifest serialization\n- `hashlib` - Checksum calculation\n- `datetime` - Timestamp generation\n\n**No External Dependencies Required**\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Installation Tests\n\n1. **Empty Directory**: Install into completely empty directory\n2. **New Directory**: Install into non-existent directory (created during install)\n3. **Existing Git Repo**: Install into directory with .git/ only\n4. **Permission Check**: Verify execute permissions on scripts\n\n### Collision Detection Tests\n\n1. **Single Collision**: One file conflicts\n2. **Multiple Collisions**: Several files conflict\n3. **No Collision**: No conflicts found\n4. **Subdirectory Collision**: Conflict in nested directory\n\n### Manifest Creation Tests\n\n1. **Manifest Structure**: Verify JSON structure (version, created, updated, files, tags)\n2. **File List Complete**: All files recorded in files array as simple strings\n3. **Files Array Format**: Files stored as relative path strings only (no metadata)\n4. **Tags Detected**: All WORKSCOPE-DEV tags found\n5. **Tags Array Format**: Tags contain only id and file fields (no line numbers)\n\n### Error Handling Tests\n\n1. **Permission Denied**: Target directory not writable\n2. **Disk Full**: Insufficient disk space\n3. **Invalid Path**: Target path is file, not directory\n4. **Partial Installation**: Interruption during copy\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Python Project**: Install into Python project\n2. **TypeScript Project**: Install into Node.js/TypeScript project\n3. **Empty Project**: Install into brand new project\n4. **Mixed Project**: Install into project with multiple languages\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **System-Architecture.md**: High-level WSD architecture and component integration\n- **Template-System.md**: Structure of files being installed\n- **Update-System.md**: How updates modify installed files\n- **WSD-Manifest-Schema.md**: Detailed .wsd format specification\n- **Install-And-Update-Overview.md**: Command-line interface for installation\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm for collision detection\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the WSD Installation System including fresh installation processes, collision detection, manifest creation, directory management, and error handling.

The `required_directories` array from wsd.json declares which directories must exist, and .wsdkeep files are generated based on the final directory state after all file operations complete.\n   614→\n   615→### Why Two Stages\n   616→\n   617→The two-stage approach solves a critical ordering problem: whether a directory needs .wsdkeep depends on its content, but that content may change during the update itself. By processing regular files first, the system knows the final directory state before making .wsdkeep decisions.\n   618→\n   619→**Example**: An update deletes `docs/workbench/old-notes.md` (the only file in that directory). If directory requirements were processed first, the system might skip .wsdkeep because the directory appears populated. With two stages, the delete happens first, then .wsdkeep is correctly added to the now-empty directory.\n   620→\n   621→### Processing Flow\n   622→\n   623→**Stage 1: Regular Files**\n   624→All content files are processed first:\n   625→- Deletions remove files (potentially emptying directories)\n   626→- Additions copy files (potentially populating directories)\n   627→- Updates modify files in place\n   628→- Skips leave protected files unchanged\n   629→\n   630→**Stage 2: Required Directories**\n   631→After regular file operations complete, the `required_directories` array is processed. For each directory path:\n   632→\n   633→1. **Ensure directory exists**: Create the directory if it doesn't exist (handles new required directories in updated WSD versions)\n   634→2. **Evaluate directory state**: Apply `_directory_needs_wsdkeep()` logic against final directory state\n   635→3. **Create .wsdkeep if needed**: Add .wsdkeep only if directory is empty\n   636→\n   637→```\n   638→Decision Logic (_directory_needs_wsdkeep):\n   639→- If directory does NOT exist → Create directory + .wsdkeep\n   640→- If directory exists but is empty → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n   641→- If directory contains only .wsdkeep → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n   642→- If directory has other content → Skip .wsdkeep (content maintains structure)\n   643→```\n   644→\n   645→### Manifest Handling\n   646→\n   647→.wsdkeep files are **never tracked in the manifest**. The manifest tracks content files only. Directory requirements are declarative (via `required_directories` in wsd.json) rather than tracked file-by-file.\n   648→\n   649→### New Required Directories\n   650→\n   651→When a WSD version adds a new required directory, updates handle this seamlessly:\n   652→\n   653→1. The new directory path appears in the update's `required_directories` array\n   654→2. Stage 1 processes regular files (establishing directory content state)\n   655→3. Stage 2 processes the new directory: ensures it exists, adds .wsdkeep if empty\n   656→\n   657→This allows WSD to evolve its directory structure without special migration logic.\n   658→\n   659→## The Update Process\n   660→\n   661→### Update Workflow Requirements\n   662→\n   663→The system MUST execute update operations in this specific order:\n   664→\n   665→**Phase 1: Preparation**\n   666→1. Read Update manifest from source\n   667→2. Read Destination manifest from target\n   668→3. Validate both manifests are well-formed\n   669→4. Categorize all files into four groups (To Delete, To Add, To Update, To Skip)\n   670→5. Validate update can proceed (permissions, disk space, etc.)\n   671→6. Log update initiation (old version, new version)\n   672→\n   673→**Phase 2: File Operations** (Two-phase processing, see § .wsdkeep Two-Phase Processing)\n   674→\n   675→**Phase 2a: Regular Files** (MUST execute in this order)\n   676→1. **Delete** all regular files in \"To Delete\" category\n   677→   - Remove files from filesystem\n   678→2. **Add** all regular files in \"To Add\" category\n   679→   - Copy files from Update to Destination\n   680→   - Set permissions from Update metadata\n   681→3. **Update** all regular files in \"To Update\" category\n   682→   - Apply content preservation for files with WORKSCOPE-DEV tags\n   683→   - Simple replacement for files without tags\n   684→   - Set permissions from Update metadata\n   685→4. **Skip** all files in \"To Skip\" category\n   686→   - Log files being skipped with reason\n   687→   - Do NOT modify files on filesystem\n   688→\n   689→**Phase 2b: .wsdkeep Candidates**\n   690→After regular file operations complete, evaluate each .wsdkeep file against the **final directory state**:\n   691→- For deletions: Delete only if directory has other content\n   692→- For additions: Add only if directory is empty or doesn't exist\n   693→- For updates/restorations: Apply same logic as additions\n   694→\n   695→**Phase 3: Finalization**\n   696→1. Create new manifest reflecting completed update\n   697→   - Include all added and updated files from Update manifest\n   698→   - Preserve metadata for skipped files from Destination manifest\n   699→   - Update modification timestamp\n   700→   - Preserve original creation timestamp\n   701→2. Write new manifest to Destination\n   702→3. Return update summary with statistics\n   703→\n   704→**Critical Requirements:**\n   705→\n   706→**Operation Order:** System MUST perform operations in specified order. MUST NOT reorder phases.\n   707→\n   708→**Atomicity (Per Design Decision 12):** If ANY error occurs during the update operation, the system MUST halt immediately, rollback all changes, and restore the previous state. This includes:\n   709→- Read errors (PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError, OSError) when reading source or destination files\n   710→- Write errors (PermissionError, disk full, etc.) when writing updated files\n   711→- Tag parsing errors (malformed tags, invalid tag IDs, missing closing tags)\n   712→- Any other exception during file processing\n   713→\n   714→There is no distinction between \"fatal\" and \"non-fatal\" errors. All errors are fatal and halt the operation.\n   715→\n   716→**Logging:** System MUST log all file operations for debugging and audit purposes.\n   717→\n   718→**Statistics:** System MUST track and return count of files in each category.\n   719→\n   720→### Update Process Phases\n   721→\n   722→#### Pre-Update Validation Requirements\n   723→\n   724→The system MUST validate update preconditions before making any filesystem modifications:\n   725→\n   726→**Permission Validation:**\n   727→- MUST verify write access to all files in \"To Update\" category\n   728→- MUST verify write access to manifest file location\n   729→- MUST verify write access to directories for new files\n   730→- If ANY permission check fails → MUST abort with descriptive error\n   731→\n   732→**Resource Validation:**\n   733→- MUST calculate total disk space required for new and updated files\n   734→- MUST verify sufficient disk space available\n   735→- If insufficient space → MUST abort with descriptive error including required vs available space\n   736→\n   737→**File Lock Validation:**\n   738→- SHOULD check if files are locked by other processes (where OS permits)\n   739→- If locked files detected → SHOULD warn user\n   740→\n   741→**Guarantee:** If validation passes, system has verified necessary permissions and resources exist\n   742→\n   743→**Contract:** Validation MUST be idempotent and read-only (no filesystem modifications)\n   744→\n   745→#### Phase 2: File Operations\n   746→Operations performed in order:\n   747→1. Delete obsolete files\n   748→2. Add new files\n   749→3. Update existing files (with preservation)\n   750→4. Skip protected files (log only)\n   751→\n   752→**Atomic Guarantee**: If any error occurs (read error, write error, tag parsing error, or any exception), the entire update is halted immediately and rolled back using the pre-update state captured in the manifest. All errors are fatal—there is no continuation on errors.\n   753→\n   754→#### Manifest Update Requirements\n   755→\n   756→The system MUST create updated manifest reflecting completed changes:\n   757→\n   758→**File List Construction:**\n   759→\n   760→Build complete list of files present after update operations (add/update/skip operations applied, delete operations removed).\n   761→\n   762→**Manifest Fields:**\n   763→\n   764→The new manifest MUST contain:\n   765→- `version`: Version from update source's wsd.json\n   766→- `created`: Creation timestamp from Destination manifest (MUST preserve original)\n   767→- `updated`: Current timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n   768→- `files`: Array of file path strings (simple list, no nested metadata)\n   769→- `tags`: Rescanned from all files (tag ID and file path only)\n   770→\n   771→**Note on Derived Data**: Checksums and permissions are NOT stored in manifest - they are derived when needed:\n   772→- Checksums: Calculated on-demand by reading file content during comparison\n   773→- Permissions: Set from update source's wsd.json executable list, queried from filesystem when needed\n   774→\n   775→**Contract:** Resulting manifest MUST be valid JSON and conform to simplified manifest schema\n   776→\n   777→### Update Sequence Diagram\n   778→\n   779→```\n   780→User                    Update System              Filesystem\n   781→ |                           |                          |\n   782→ |-- wsd.py install path -->|                          |\n   783→ |                           |                          |\n   784→ |                           |------ Check .wsd ------->|\n   785→ |                           |<----- exists ------------|\n   786→ |                           |                          |\n   787→ |                           |------ Read manifests --->|\n   788→ |                           |<----- manifests ---------|\n   789→ |                           |                          |\n   790→ |                           |                          |\n   791→ |                           |-- Categorize files       |\n   792→ |                           |   (set operations)       |\n   793→ |                           |                          |\n   794→ |                           |-- Validate update        |\n   795→ |                           |                          |\n   796→ |<-- Show preview ---------|                          |\n   797→ |    (if --dry-run)         |                          |\n   798→ |                           |                          |\n   799→ |                           |------ Delete files ----->|\n   800→ |                           |<----- deleted -----------|\n   801→ |                           |                          |\n   802→ |                           |------ Add files -------->|\n   803→ |                           |<----- added -------------|\n   804→ |                           |                          |\n   805→ |                           |------ Update files ----->|\n   806→ |                           |  (with preservation)     |\n   807→ |                           |<----- updated -----------|\n   808→ |                           |                          |\n   809→ |                           |------ Write manifest --->|\n   810→ |                           |<----- written -----------|\n   811→ |                           |                          |\n   812→ |<-- Success summary ------|                          |\n   813→```\n   814→\n   815→## Dry-Run Mode\n   816→\n   817→### Purpose\n   818→\n   819→The `--dry-run` flag allows users to preview update changes without applying them.

For additions and updates, `.wsdkeep` files are omitted from the preview if the target directory contains content (since the actual update would skip creating them). For deletions, `.wsdkeep` files are omitted from the preview if the target directory is empty or needs structure preservation (since the actual update would preserve them). This ensures the preview accurately represents the two-phase processing behavior where `.wsdkeep` decisions depend on final directory state.

Always commit to version control before updating\n  1141→2. Review dry-run output before proceeding\n  1142→3. Keep backups of critical customizations\n  1143→4. Test updates on non-production projects first\n  1144→\n  1145→**For Implementers:**\n  1146→1. Validate early and fail fast\n  1147→2. Provide clear, actionable error messages\n  1148→3. Implement atomic operations where possible\n  1149→4. Log all operations for debugging (use `--verbose` / `-v` flag)\n  1150→5. Never leave installations in broken states\n  1151→\n  1152→## Edge Cases\n  1153→\n  1154→### Concurrent Updates\n  1155→\n  1156→**Scenario**: Multiple users updating same shared repository simultaneously\n  1157→\n  1158→**Current Behavior (v1)**:\n  1159→- No locking mechanism\n  1160→- Last update wins\n  1161→- Potential for conflicting changes\n  1162→\n  1163→**Handling**:\n  1164→```\n  1165→Warning: Another update may be in progress\n  1166→Evidence: .wsd file modified recently (< 5 minutes ago)\n  1167→Action: Ensure no other update operations are running.\n  1168→        Conflicts may occur with concurrent updates.\n  1169→        Proceed?

The update system's content hash comparison ensures that only files with actual differences are updated, providing self-healing behavior for any incomplete state from previous operations.\n  1190→\n  1191→### Self-Healing Updates\n  1192→\n  1193→The update system implements self-healing behavior through content hash comparison. When an update is performed:\n  1194→\n  1195→1. **Content-Based Detection**: Files are compared by content hash, not timestamps\n  1196→2. **Automatic Recovery**: If previous operations left partial changes, the update automatically brings files to the correct state\n  1197→3. **Minimal I/O**: Files with matching content are skipped, reducing unnecessary operations\n  1198→\n  1199→This design eliminates the need for complex interrupted update detection and recovery procedures. Any incomplete state is naturally corrected by the next update operation.\n  1200→\n  1201→For more details on content hashing, see **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n  1202→\n  1203→### Manifest Version Mismatch\n  1204→\n  1205→**Scenario**: Update manifest has older version than destination manifest\n  1206→\n  1207→**Detection Implementation:**\n  1208→\n  1209→System detects version downgrades using `compare_versions()` function:\n  1210→\n  1211→**Version Comparison Process:**\n  1212→1.

It provides a robust mechanism for comparing installed files against new template versions, intelligently preserving content within WORKSCOPE-DEV tags, respecting no_overwrite policies for user-owned files, and maintaining the integrity of the .wsd manifest.\n\nThis specification defines the complete update process including update detection, file comparison algorithms, content preservation, manifest updates, and error handling for WSD Runtime updates.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Update System serves five critical functions:\n\n1. **Safe Updates**: Replaces outdated WSD Runtime files with new versions without losing user customizations\n2. **Content Preservation**: Maintains user content within WORKSCOPE-DEV tags across template updates\n3. **File Protection**: Respects no_overwrite policies to prevent overwriting user-owned files\n4. **Structure Synchronization**: Adds new files, removes obsolete files, and updates changed files\n5. **Manifest Maintenance**: Updates the .wsd manifest to reflect the current installation state\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of update procedures, file comparison logic, content preservation algorithms, and update verification.\n\n## Update Detection\n\n### Detecting Updates Are Available\n\nThe update mechanism is triggered when a user explicitly runs the update command. WSD does not include automatic update checking or notification systems in v1.\n\n**User-Initiated Update**:\n```bash\nwsd.py update /path/to/project\n```\n\n**Preconditions for Update**:\n1. Target directory contains .wsd manifest file (indicates WSD installation)\n2. User has newer version of WSD Runtime (with wsd.json present)\n3. User has write permissions to target directory\n\n### Installation Mode Detection\n\nThe `detect_installation_mode()` function determines whether the target directory requires a fresh installation or an update operation.\n\n**Function Signature**:\n```python\ndef detect_installation_mode(target_dir: Path) -> InstallationMode\n```\n\n**Decision Logic**:\n1. If target directory does not exist → Returns `mode=\"fresh\"`\n2. If target exists but no .wsd manifest → Returns `mode=\"fresh\"`\n3. If target exists with valid .wsd manifest → Returns `mode=\"update\"`\n\n**Return Value**:\n\nThe function returns an `InstallationMode` dataclass containing:\n- `mode`: String \"fresh\" or \"update\"\n- `manifest_data`: Parsed manifest dictionary (None for fresh installs)\n- `version`: Installed version string (None for fresh installs)\n- `files`: List of installed file paths (None for fresh installs)\n\n**Implementation Details**:\n\nFor update scenarios, the function:\n1. Parses the manifest using `read_manifest()` utility\n2. Validates structure using `validate_manifest()` utility\n3. Extracts version from manifest `version` field\n4. Extracts files list from manifest `files` array\n\n**Error Handling**:\n- Raises `json.JSONDecodeError` if manifest JSON is malformed\n- Raises `ValueError` if manifest structure is invalid\n- Both errors indicate corrupted installation requiring manual recovery\n\n**Usage Example**:\n```python\nmode_info = detect_installation_mode(Path(\"/path/to/project\"))\n\nif mode_info.mode == \"fresh\":\n    # Perform fresh installation\n    install_files(source_dir, target_dir)\nelif mode_info.mode == \"update\":\n    # Perform update with manifest data\n    current_version = mode_info.version\n    installed_files = mode_info.files\n    perform_update(source_dir, target_dir, mode_info)\n```\n\n### Manifest Structure\n\nFor complete .wsd manifest specification including JSON schema, field semantics, derived data model, validation rules, and examples, see **WSD-Manifest-Schema.md**.\n\n### Version Compatibility\n\n**Version Information Sources**:\n- **Installed Version**: Extracted from .wsd manifest via `detect_installation_mode()`\n- **Update Version**: Read from WSD Runtime's `wsd.json` `version` field (see **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md** for complete wsd.json specification)\n\n**Version Comparison Implementation**:\n\nThe update system implements semantic version comparison through four core functions:\n\n**1. `parse_semantic_version(version_str: str) -> SemanticVersion`**\n- Parses version string in major.minor.patch format\n- Validates pattern matches `^\\d+\\.\\d+\\.\\d+$`\n- Returns SemanticVersion dataclass with integer components (major, minor, patch)\n- Raises ValueError for invalid formats (missing components, non-numeric, negative values)\n\n**2. `compare_versions(version1: str, version2: str) -> str`**\n- Compares two version strings using semantic versioning rules\n- Returns \"upgrade\" if version2 > version1 (newer)\n- Returns \"downgrade\" if version2 < version1 (older)\n- Returns \"same\" if version2 == version1 (identical)\n- Comparison hierarchy: major > minor > patch\n\n**3. `check_version_compatibility(installed_version: str, update_version: str) -> bool`**\n- Determines if update operation is compatible\n- Returns True for upgrades and same-version reinstalls\n- Returns False for downgrades\n- Raises ValueError for invalid version strings\n\n**4. `format_downgrade_warning(installed_version: str, update_version: str) -> str`**\n- Creates comprehensive warning message for downgrade attempts\n- Includes both version numbers\n- Lists potential risks (feature loss, incompatibility, data loss)\n- Provides recommendation to use version control instead\n\n**5. `confirm_downgrade(installed_version: str, update_version: str) -> bool`**\n- Displays downgrade warning to user on stderr\n- Prompts for explicit confirmation: \"Proceed with downgrade? [y/N]\"\n- Returns True only for explicit \"y\" or \"yes\" responses (case-insensitive)\n- Treats empty responses, \"no\", EOF, and KeyboardInterrupt as rejection\n- Ensures users make informed decision about downgrade risks\n\n**Downgrade Handling**:\n- Downgrades are detected but not forbidden outright\n- System displays comprehensive warning explaining risks\n- Requires explicit user confirmation to proceed\n- Only \"y\" or \"yes\" (case-insensitive) confirms downgrade\n- Any other response (including empty, \"n\", \"no\", or interrupt) cancels operation\n\n**Future Considerations** (not v1):\n- Version-specific migration logic\n- Compatibility matrices\n- Breaking change warnings\n\n## File Comparison Algorithm\n\n### Overview\n\nThe file comparison algorithm determines which files need to be added, updated, deleted, or skipped based on comparing the installed manifest against the update source. The algorithm uses content hash comparison to accurately identify files with identical content, skipping unnecessary updates even when files exist in both installations. For hash calculation algorithm and storage format, see **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n### Comparison Process\n\n```python\ndef compare_installations(installed_manifest, update_source_dir, update_metadata):\n    \"\"\"\n    Compare installed WSD against update source to categorize files.\n\n    Args:\n        installed_manifest: Parsed .wsd manifest from target directory\n        update_source_dir: Path to WSD Runtime root directory\n        update_metadata: Parsed wsd.json from WSD Runtime\n\n    Returns:\n        dict: Categorized file lists (to_add, to_update, to_delete, to_skip)\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get file lists\n    installed_files = set(installed_manifest['files'])\n    update_files = set(get_all_files(update_source_dir))\n\n    # Get protection policy from UPDATE's wsd.json (Source of Truth)\n    no_overwrite_files = set(update_metadata.get('no_overwrite', []))\n\n    # Categorize using set operations\n    to_delete = installed_files - update_files\n    to_add = update_files - installed_files\n\n    # Files in both installations need further analysis\n    in_both = installed_files & update_files\n\n    to_update = []\n    to_skip = []\n\n    for file_path in in_both:\n        if file_path in no_overwrite_files:\n            # Protected file - skip updating\n            to_skip.append({\n                'path': file_path,\n                'reason': 'no_overwrite protection'\n            })\n        else:\n            # Regular file - update it\n            to_update.append(file_path)\n\n    return {\n        'to_add': list(to_add),\n        'to_update': to_update,\n        'to_delete': list(to_delete),\n        'to_skip': to_skip\n    }\n```\n\n### Categorization Rules\n\n#### Files to Delete\n**Definition**: Files present in installed manifest but not in update source.\n\n**Logic**: `installed_files - update_files`\n\n**Action**: Remove from target directory and manifest.\n\n**Special Cases**:\n- If file was manually modified by user, still delete (WSD-managed files)\n- User can recover via version control if needed\n\n**.wsdkeep Files**: See § .wsdkeep Two-Phase Processing below for how .wsdkeep deletions are evaluated.\n\n#### Files to Add\n**Definition**: Files present in update source but not in installed manifest.\n\n**Logic**: `update_files - installed_files`\n\n**Action**: Copy from update source to target, add to manifest.\n\n**Special Cases**:\n- If file exists in target but not in manifest, treat as collision (should not happen in normal usage)\n- Set executable permissions if file in executable list\n- Scan for tags and add to manifest\n\n**.wsdkeep Files**: See § .wsdkeep Two-Phase Processing below for how .wsdkeep additions are evaluated.\n\n#### Files to Update\n**Definition**: Files present in both, not protected by no_overwrite.\n\n**Logic**: `(installed_files ∩ update_files) - no_overwrite_files`\n\n**Action**: Replace with update version, preserving WORKSCOPE-DEV tag content.\n\n**Special Cases**:\n- If file has WORKSCOPE-DEV tags, apply preservation algorithm\n- If file has no tags, simple overwrite\n- Update executable permissions from wsd.json\n\n**.wsdkeep Files**: See § .wsdkeep Two-Phase Processing below for how .wsdkeep updates/restorations are evaluated.\n\n#### Files to Skip\n**Definition**: Files present in both, protected by no_overwrite.\n\n**Logic**: `(installed_files ∩ update_files) ∩ no_overwrite_files`\n\n**Action**: Leave installed version unchanged, log as skipped.\n\n**Rationale**: These files represent user's work (like Action-Plan.md), not template infrastructure.\n\n### no_overwrite Source of Truth\n\nFor complete no_overwrite policy specification including Source of Truth principle, behavior, and design rationale, see **Template-System.md § File Protection: no_overwrite Policy**.\n\n**Key Principle for Updates**: The UPDATE's wsd.json no_overwrite array is authoritative, not the installed manifest. This allows protection policy to evolve between versions.\n\n**Update Behavior**:\n- Read no_overwrite array from UPDATE's wsd.json\n- If file in no_overwrite array exists in target → Skip updating (preserve user's version)\n- Protection policy can change between versions as template evolves\n\n## File Comparison Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Simple Update\n\n**Destination Manifest:**\n```json\n{\n    \"files\": [\n        \".claude/agents/task-master.md\",\n        \".claude/agents/rule-enforcer.md\",\n        \"scripts/health_check.py\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Update Source Files:**\n```\n.claude/agents/task-master.md\n.claude/agents/rule-enforcer.md\n.claude/agents/new-agent.md\nscripts/health_check.py\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- To Delete: (none)\n- To Add: `.claude/agents/new-agent.md`\n- To Update: `.claude/agents/task-master.md`, `.claude/agents/rule-enforcer.md`, `scripts/health_check.py`\n- To Skip: (none)\n\n#### Example 2: Update with no_overwrite\n\n**Destination Manifest:**\n```json\n{\n    \"files\": [\n        \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n        \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n        \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Update Source wsd.json:**\n```json\n{\n    \"version\": \"1.1.0\",\n    \"no_overwrite\": [\n        \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n        \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n        \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\",\n        \"config/local-settings.json\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- To Delete: (none)\n- To Add: (none)\n- To Update: (none - all user-owned files are protected)\n- To Skip: `docs/core/Action-Plan.md`, `docs/core/PRD.md`, `dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md` (all protected by no_overwrite in wsd.json)\n\n#### Example 3: File Removal\n\n**Destination Manifest:**\n```json\n{\n    \"files\": [\n        \".claude/agents/old-agent.md\",\n        \".claude/agents/task-master.md\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n**Update Source Files:**\n```\n.claude/agents/task-master.md\n```\n\n**Result:**\n- To Delete: `.claude/agents/old-agent.md`\n- To Add: (none)\n- To Update: `.claude/agents/task-master.md`\n- To Skip: (none)\n\n#### Example 4: .wsdkeep Two-Phase Processing\n\n**Scenario:** Update adds a new required directory `dev/experiments/` while user has populated `docs/workbench/`.\n\n**Update Source Files (includes .wsdkeep):**\n```\ndocs/workbench/.wsdkeep\ndev/experiments/.wsdkeep\nscripts/health_check.py\n```\n\n**Target Directory State Before Update:**\n```\ndocs/workbench/\n├── my-notes.md      # User's file\n└── analysis.md      # User's file\n# Note: No dev/experiments/ directory exists yet\n```\n\n**Processing:**\n1. **Phase 2a (Regular Files):** Update `scripts/health_check.py`\n2. **Phase 2b (.wsdkeep Candidates):**\n   - `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep`: Directory has user content → Skip\n   - `dev/experiments/.wsdkeep`: Directory doesn't exist → Create with .wsdkeep\n\n**Result:**\n```\ndocs/workbench/\n├── my-notes.md      # Preserved\n└── analysis.md      # Preserved (no .wsdkeep added)\n\ndev/experiments/\n└── .wsdkeep         # Created (new required directory)\n```\n\n**Rationale:** .wsdkeep files are evaluated against final directory state. Populated directories don't receive .wsdkeep; new required directories do.\n\n## Content Preservation During Updates\n\n### Integration with Template System\n\nThe Update System applies the content preservation algorithm defined in **Template-System.md § Content Preservation Algorithm** during file update operations.\n\n**Algorithm Reference:** See Template-System.md for:\n- Complete preservation algorithm specification\n- Tag detection and content extraction logic\n- Preservation rules and guarantees\n- Edge case handling (malformed tags, special characters, etc.)\n\n**Update System Role:** This section specifies WHEN and WHERE the preservation algorithm applies during update operations, not HOW the algorithm works (which is defined in the Template spec).\n\n### Preservation Requirements\n\nFor each file in the \"To Update\" category, the system MUST:\n\n**Content Preservation Decision:**\n1. Read both Update file and Destination file\n2. Scan Update file for WORKSCOPE-DEV tags\n3. Apply appropriate update strategy:\n   - If WORKSCOPE-DEV tags present → MUST use tag preservation algorithm\n   - If no WORKSCOPE-DEV tags → MUST perform simple file replacement\n\n**Tag Preservation Process:**\n\nWhen WORKSCOPE-DEV tags detected, system MUST apply the preservation algorithm from **Template-System.md § Content Preservation Algorithm**, ensuring:\n1. User content within tags preserved byte-for-byte\n2. Template context around tags updated from Update file\n3. New tags receive initial content from Update file\n4. Result written to Destination path\n\n**Guarantee:** User content within WORKSCOPE-DEV tags MUST be preserved byte-for-byte across updates\n\n**Simple Replacement Process:**\n\nWhen no WORKSCOPE-DEV tags detected, system MUST:\n1. Copy Update file content directly to Destination path\n2. No content analysis or preservation required\n\n**Post-Write Requirements:**\n\nAfter writing file content, system MUST:\n1. Set file permissions from update source's wsd.json executable list (if applicable)\n2. File added to manifest's files array (simple path string)\n\n**Note**: Checksums are calculated on-demand when needed for comparison, not stored in manifest.\n\n**Contract:** Preservation algorithm defined in **Template-System.md § Content Preservation Algorithm** is the authoritative source for tag handling. This section provides update-specific requirements only.\n\n### Preservation Examples in Update Context\n\n**Note:** The following examples demonstrate content preservation during update operations. For complete algorithm specification including tag syntax, preservation rules, and edge case handling, see **Template-System.md § Content Preservation Algorithm**.

The `required_directories` array from wsd.json declares which directories must exist, and .wsdkeep files are generated based on the final directory state after all file operations complete.\n\n### Why Two Stages\n\nThe two-stage approach solves a critical ordering problem: whether a directory needs .wsdkeep depends on its content, but that content may change during the update itself. By processing regular files first, the system knows the final directory state before making .wsdkeep decisions.\n\n**Example**: An update deletes `docs/workbench/old-notes.md` (the only file in that directory). If directory requirements were processed first, the system might skip .wsdkeep because the directory appears populated. With two stages, the delete happens first, then .wsdkeep is correctly added to the now-empty directory.\n\n### Processing Flow\n\n**Stage 1: Regular Files**\nAll content files are processed first:\n- Deletions remove files (potentially emptying directories)\n- Additions copy files (potentially populating directories)\n- Updates modify files in place\n- Skips leave protected files unchanged\n\n**Stage 2: Required Directories**\nAfter regular file operations complete, the `required_directories` array is processed. For each directory path:\n\n1. **Ensure directory exists**: Create the directory if it doesn't exist (handles new required directories in updated WSD versions)\n2. **Evaluate directory state**: Apply `_directory_needs_wsdkeep()` logic against final directory state\n3. **Create .wsdkeep if needed**: Add .wsdkeep only if directory is empty\n\n```\nDecision Logic (_directory_needs_wsdkeep):\n- If directory does NOT exist → Create directory + .wsdkeep\n- If directory exists but is empty → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n- If directory contains only .wsdkeep → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n- If directory has other content → Skip .wsdkeep (content maintains structure)\n```\n\n### Manifest Handling\n\n.wsdkeep files are **never tracked in the manifest**. The manifest tracks content files only. Directory requirements are declarative (via `required_directories` in wsd.json) rather than tracked file-by-file.\n\n### New Required Directories\n\nWhen a WSD version adds a new required directory, updates handle this seamlessly:\n\n1. The new directory path appears in the update's `required_directories` array\n2. Stage 1 processes regular files (establishing directory content state)\n3. Stage 2 processes the new directory: ensures it exists, adds .wsdkeep if empty\n\nThis allows WSD to evolve its directory structure without special migration logic.\n\n## The Update Process\n\n### Update Workflow Requirements\n\nThe system MUST execute update operations in this specific order:\n\n**Phase 1: Preparation**\n1. Read Update manifest from source\n2. Read Destination manifest from target\n3. Validate both manifests are well-formed\n4. Categorize all files into four groups (To Delete, To Add, To Update, To Skip)\n5. Validate update can proceed (permissions, disk space, etc.)\n6. Log update initiation (old version, new version)\n\n**Phase 2: File Operations** (Two-phase processing, see § .wsdkeep Two-Phase Processing)\n\n**Phase 2a: Regular Files** (MUST execute in this order)\n1. **Delete** all regular files in \"To Delete\" category\n   - Remove files from filesystem\n2. **Add** all regular files in \"To Add\" category\n   - Copy files from Update to Destination\n   - Set permissions from Update metadata\n3. **Update** all regular files in \"To Update\" category\n   - Apply content preservation for files with WORKSCOPE-DEV tags\n   - Simple replacement for files without tags\n   - Set permissions from Update metadata\n4. **Skip** all files in \"To Skip\" category\n   - Log files being skipped with reason\n   - Do NOT modify files on filesystem\n\n**Phase 2b: .wsdkeep Candidates**\nAfter regular file operations complete, evaluate each .wsdkeep file against the **final directory state**:\n- For deletions: Delete only if directory has other content\n- For additions: Add only if directory is empty or doesn't exist\n- For updates/restorations: Apply same logic as additions\n\n**Phase 3: Finalization**\n1. Create new manifest reflecting completed update\n   - Include all added and updated files from Update manifest\n   - Preserve metadata for skipped files from Destination manifest\n   - Update modification timestamp\n   - Preserve original creation timestamp\n2. Write new manifest to Destination\n3. Return update summary with statistics\n\n**Critical Requirements:**\n\n**Operation Order:** System MUST perform operations in specified order. MUST NOT reorder phases.\n\n**Atomicity (Per Design Decision 12):** If ANY error occurs during the update operation, the system MUST halt immediately, rollback all changes, and restore the previous state. This includes:\n- Read errors (PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError, OSError) when reading source or destination files\n- Write errors (PermissionError, disk full, etc.) when writing updated files\n- Tag parsing errors (malformed tags, invalid tag IDs, missing closing tags)\n- Any other exception during file processing\n\nThere is no distinction between \"fatal\" and \"non-fatal\" errors. All errors are fatal and halt the operation.\n\n**Logging:** System MUST log all file operations for debugging and audit purposes.\n\n**Statistics:** System MUST track and return count of files in each category.\n\n### Update Process Phases\n\n#### Pre-Update Validation Requirements\n\nThe system MUST validate update preconditions before making any filesystem modifications:\n\n**Permission Validation:**\n- MUST verify write access to all files in \"To Update\" category\n- MUST verify write access to manifest file location\n- MUST verify write access to directories for new files\n- If ANY permission check fails → MUST abort with descriptive error\n\n**Resource Validation:**\n- MUST calculate total disk space required for new and updated files\n- MUST verify sufficient disk space available\n- If insufficient space → MUST abort with descriptive error including required vs available space\n\n**File Lock Validation:**\n- SHOULD check if files are locked by other processes (where OS permits)\n- If locked files detected → SHOULD warn user\n\n**Guarantee:** If validation passes, system has verified necessary permissions and resources exist\n\n**Contract:** Validation MUST be idempotent and read-only (no filesystem modifications)\n\n#### Phase 2: File Operations\nOperations performed in order:\n1. Delete obsolete files\n2. Add new files\n3. Update existing files (with preservation)\n4. Skip protected files (log only)\n\n**Atomic Guarantee**: If any error occurs (read error, write error, tag parsing error, or any exception), the entire update is halted immediately and rolled back using the pre-update state captured in the manifest. All errors are fatal—there is no continuation on errors.\n\n#### Manifest Update Requirements\n\nThe system MUST create updated manifest reflecting completed changes:\n\n**File List Construction:**\n\nBuild complete list of files present after update operations (add/update/skip operations applied, delete operations removed).\n\n**Manifest Fields:**\n\nThe new manifest MUST contain:\n- `version`: Version from update source's wsd.json\n- `created`: Creation timestamp from Destination manifest (MUST preserve original)\n- `updated`: Current timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n- `files`: Array of file path strings (simple list, no nested metadata)\n- `tags`: Rescanned from all files (tag ID and file path only)\n\n**Note on Derived Data**: Checksums and permissions are NOT stored in manifest - they are derived when needed:\n- Checksums: Calculated on-demand by reading file content during comparison\n- Permissions: Set from update source's wsd.json executable list, queried from filesystem when needed\n\n**Contract:** Resulting manifest MUST be valid JSON and conform to simplified manifest schema\n\n### Update Sequence Diagram\n\n```\nUser                    Update System              Filesystem\n |                           |                          |\n |-- wsd.py install path -->|                          |\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |------ Check .wsd ------->|\n |                           |<----- exists ------------|\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |------ Read manifests --->|\n |                           |<----- manifests ---------|\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |-- Categorize files       |\n |                           |   (set operations)       |\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |-- Validate update        |\n |                           |                          |\n |<-- Show preview ---------|                          |\n |    (if --dry-run)         |                          |\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |------ Delete files ----->|\n |                           |<----- deleted -----------|\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |------ Add files -------->|\n |                           |<----- added -------------|\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |------ Update files ----->|\n |                           |  (with preservation)     |\n |                           |<----- updated -----------|\n |                           |                          |\n |                           |------ Write manifest --->|\n |                           |<----- written -----------|\n |                           |                          |\n |<-- Success summary ------|                          |\n```\n\n## Dry-Run Mode\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `--dry-run` flag allows users to preview update changes without applying them. This is critical for:\n\n1. **Safety**: Review changes before committing to update\n2. **Understanding**: See what will be modified\n3. **Decision Making**: Decide whether to proceed with update\n4. **Debugging**: Troubleshoot unexpected update behavior\n\n### Dry-Run Requirements\n\nWhen invoked in dry-run mode, the system MUST preview update without modifications:\n\n**Analysis Phase:**\n\nSystem MUST perform same analysis as normal update:\n1. Read both manifests\n2. Categorize files into four groups\n3. Perform validation checks (where possible without modifications)\n\n**Report Generation:**\n\nSystem MUST generate preview report containing:\n\n**Version Information:**\n- Current version from Destination manifest\n- Update version from Update manifest\n\n**Change Categories:**\n- Complete list of files to delete\n- Complete list of files to add\n- Complete list of files to update\n- Complete list of files to skip (with reasons)\n\n**Statistics:**\n- Total file count before update\n- Total file count after update\n- Count of files in each category\n- Count of protected files\n\n**Critical Guarantee:** System MUST NOT modify ANY files during dry-run\n\n**Critical Guarantee:** System MUST NOT write manifest during dry-run\n\n**Contract:** Dry-run report MUST accurately reflect what normal update would do\n\n**.wsdkeep Filtering:** The dry-run preview filters `.wsdkeep` files based on target directory state to accurately reflect actual update behavior. For additions and updates, `.wsdkeep` files are omitted from the preview if the target directory contains content (since the actual update would skip creating them). For deletions, `.wsdkeep` files are omitted from the preview if the target directory is empty or needs structure preservation (since the actual update would preserve them). This ensures the preview accurately represents the two-phase processing behavior where `.wsdkeep` decisions depend on final directory state. See Template-System.md § .wsdkeep Placeholder Files for the complete `.wsdkeep` conceptual model.\n\n**Output Requirement:** System MUST present report in human-readable format with clear instructions for proceeding\n\n### Dry-Run Output Format\n\n**Console Output:**\n```\nWSD Update Preview (--dry-run)\n==============================\n\nCurrent Version: 1.0.0\nUpdate Version:  1.1.0\n\nChanges Summary\n---------------\nFiles to delete:  2\nFiles to add:     3\nFiles to update:  15\nFiles to skip:    1\n\nFiles to Delete\n---------------\n  - .claude/agents/deprecated-agent.md\n  - scripts/old_utility.py\n\nFiles to Add\n------------\n  + .claude/agents/new-feature-agent.md\n  + docs/read-only/standards/New-Standard.md\n  + scripts/new_utility.py\n\nFiles to Update (with content preservation)\n--------------------------------------------\n  ~ .claude/commands/ws-init.md\n  ~ .claude/commands/ws-execute.md\n  ~ docs/read-only/Agent-System.md\n  [... 12 more files ...]\n\nFiles to Skip (protected by no_overwrite)\n------------------------------------------\n  = docs/core/Action-Plan.md (user-owned content)\n\nStatistics\n----------\nCurrent file count: 45\nUpdated file count: 46\nTotal changes:      20\n\nTo proceed with this update, run:\n  wsd.py install /path/to/project\n\nTo cancel, take no action.\n```\n\n### Dry-Run Implementation\n\n```bash\n# User runs dry-run\n$ wsd.py install --dry-run ~/projects/my-project\n\n# System performs:\n# 1.

Post-Update Errors\n\n**Manifest Write Error:**\n```\nError: Cannot update .wsd manifest after file operations\nLocation: /Users/dev/project/.wsd\nReason: Permission denied\nAction: Files updated successfully, but manifest not updated.\n        This may cause issues with future updates.\n        Grant write permission to .wsd:\n          chmod u+w .wsd\n        Then re-run update to sync manifest.\n```\n\n### Error Recovery\n\n#### Automatic Rollback Requirements\n\nFor errors during file operations, system MUST attempt rollback:\n\n**Rollback Point Creation:**\n\nBefore beginning file operations, system MUST:\n1. Record current manifest state\n2. Record current timestamp\n3. Attempt to record VCS commit hash (if available)\n\n**Rollback Trigger:**\n\nSystem MUST initiate rollback when:\n- Any file deletion fails\n- Any file addition fails\n- Any file update fails\n- Any permission error occurs\n- Manifest write fails\n\n**Rollback Process:**\n\nOn error detection, system MUST:\n1. Halt all further file operations immediately\n2. Restore manifest to pre-update state\n3. Provide recovery instructions to user\n4. Report error with full context\n\n**v1 Rollback Scope:**\n\nThe system implements v1 rollback through:\n\n1. **RollbackPoint Structure**: Dataclass capturing manifest_state, timestamp, vcs_commit_hash, and manifest_path\n2. **Rollback Point Creation**: Created before file operations begin via `create_rollback_point()` function\n3. **VCS Hash Detection**: `get_vcs_commit_hash()` attempts to retrieve git commit hash with graceful fallback to None\n4. **Error Propagation**: File operation functions raise exceptions instead of calling sys.exit directly\n5. **Manifest Restoration**: `restore_manifest_on_error()` writes original manifest back to disk\n6. **Recovery Instructions**: Provides git checkout commands with specific commit hash (if available) or HEAD fallback\n\n**Implementation Details:**\n\nThe `create_rollback_point()` function:\n- Records complete manifest state for restoration\n- Captures ISO 8601 timestamp of rollback point creation\n- Runs `git rev-parse HEAD` in target directory to get commit hash\n- Returns None for VCS hash if not a git repository or command fails\n\nThe `restore_manifest_on_error()` function:\n- Restores manifest to pre-update state via `write_manifest()`\n- Displays recovery banner with failure timestamp\n- Provides two recovery options: selective file restoration or full reset\n- Uses commit hash for precise restoration when available\n- Falls back to HEAD when commit hash not available\n\n**Future Rollback Enhancement** (not v1):\n- Automated file-level restoration (rolling back file changes, not just manifest)\n- Transaction logs for precise rollback\n- Snapshot-based recovery\n\n**Guarantee:** If update fails, manifest MUST be restored to pre-update state\n\n**Contract:** System MUST NOT leave installation in partially updated state with inconsistent manifest\n\n#### Manual Recovery\n\nFor situations requiring manual intervention:\n\n**Recovery via Version Control:**\n```bash\n# Restore all WSD files to previous state\ngit checkout .claude/ docs/ scripts/ .wsd\n\n# Or restore specific file\ngit checkout .claude/agents/task-master.md\n```\n\n**Recovery via Fresh Install:**\n```bash\n# Remove corrupted installation\nrm -rf .claude/ docs/read-only/ scripts/ .wsd\n\n# Perform fresh install\nwsd.py install .\n\n# Restore user content from backup\ngit checkout docs/core/Action-Plan.md\n# Manually restore WORKSCOPE-DEV tag content if needed\n```\n\n### Error Handling Best Practices\n\n**For Users:**\n1. Always commit to version control before updating\n2. Review dry-run output before proceeding\n3. Keep backups of critical customizations\n4. Test updates on non-production projects first\n\n**For Implementers:**\n1. Validate early and fail fast\n2. Provide clear, actionable error messages\n3. Implement atomic operations where possible\n4. Log all operations for debugging (use `--verbose` / `-v` flag)\n5. Never leave installations in broken states\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n### Concurrent Updates\n\n**Scenario**: Multiple users updating same shared repository simultaneously\n\n**Current Behavior (v1)**:\n- No locking mechanism\n- Last update wins\n- Potential for conflicting changes\n\n**Handling**:\n```\nWarning: Another update may be in progress\nEvidence: .wsd file modified recently (< 5 minutes ago)\nAction: Ensure no other update operations are running.\n        Conflicts may occur with concurrent updates.\n        Proceed? [y/N]\n```\n\n**Future Consideration**: File locking during updates\n\n### Temporary Files\n\n**Scenario**: Leftover temporary files exist from previous operations\n\n**Detection**: The update system checks for the presence of temporary files (`.wsd.tmp`, `.wsd.bak`, `.update-in-progress`) before proceeding with an update.\n\n**Behavior**: If temporary files are detected, the system displays a non-blocking warning:\n\n```\nWarning: Temporary update files detected\nFiles found: .wsd.tmp, .wsd.bak\nThese files may be left over from a previous operation.\nConsider removing them if they are not needed.\n```\n\nThe warning is informational only and does not block the update operation. The update system's content hash comparison ensures that only files with actual differences are updated, providing self-healing behavior for any incomplete state from previous operations.\n\n### Self-Healing Updates\n\nThe update system implements self-healing behavior through content hash comparison. When an update is performed:\n\n1. **Content-Based Detection**: Files are compared by content hash, not timestamps\n2. **Automatic Recovery**: If previous operations left partial changes, the update automatically brings files to the correct state\n3. **Minimal I/O**: Files with matching content are skipped, reducing unnecessary operations\n\nThis design eliminates the need for complex interrupted update detection and recovery procedures. Any incomplete state is naturally corrected by the next update operation.\n\nFor more details on content hashing, see **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**.\n\n### Manifest Version Mismatch\n\n**Scenario**: Update manifest has older version than destination manifest\n\n**Detection Implementation:**\n\nSystem detects version downgrades using `compare_versions()` function:\n\n**Version Comparison Process:**\n1. Parse both versions using `parse_semantic_version()` (validates format)\n2. Compare using semantic versioning rules (major > minor > patch)\n3. Return \"upgrade\", \"downgrade\", or \"same\" based on comparison\n\n**Compatibility Check:**\n- Call `check_version_compatibility(installed_version, update_version)`\n- Returns True for upgrades and same-version reinstalls\n- Returns False for downgrades\n\n**User Notification:**\n- System displays comprehensive warning using `format_downgrade_warning()`\n- Warning includes both version numbers\n- Lists potential risks (feature loss, incompatibility, data loss, manifest inconsistencies)\n- Recommends using version control to revert specific files instead\n- Requires explicit user confirmation via `confirm_downgrade()`\n\n**Confirmation Requirements:**\n- Prompt displayed on stderr: \"Proceed with downgrade? [y/N]\"\n- Only explicit \"y\" or \"yes\" (case-insensitive) confirms downgrade\n- Empty response, \"n\", \"no\", EOF, or KeyboardInterrupt cancels operation\n- Whitespace stripped from user input before evaluation\n\n**Contract:** Version comparison follows semantic versioning specification (major.minor.patch)\n\n**Example Output**:\n```\nWARNING: Version Downgrade Detected\n====================================\n\nInstalled Version: 1.1.0\nUpdate Version:    1.0.0\n\nThis operation would downgrade your WSD installation to an older version.\n\nDowngrade operations are not officially supported and may cause:\n  - Loss of newer features and improvements\n  - Incompatibility issues with existing customizations\n  - Potential data loss in WORKSCOPE-DEV tags\n  - Manifest inconsistencies\n\nRecommendation: Use version control to revert specific files if needed,\nrather than downgrading the entire WSD installation.\n\nProceed with downgrade? [y/N]\n```\n\n### File Permission Changes\n\nFor complete file permission model, see **Template-System.md § File Permission Model**.\n\n**Update-Specific Behavior**:\n\nDuring file updates, system MUST:\n1. Read executable list from Update source's wsd.json\n2. Apply +x permissions to files in executable list\n3. Log permission changes for user visibility\n\n**Permission Change Logging**:\n```\nUpdate Report:\n...\nPermission Changes:\n  scripts/health_check.py: 644 -> 755 (now executable)\n  scripts/demo.sh: 644 -> 755 (now executable)\n```\n\nUsers see which files gained executable permission, allowing them to verify expected changes.\n\n### Large File Handling\n\n**Scenario**: Files exceed reasonable size for in-memory processing\n\n**Current Limit**: No explicit limit (limited by system memory)\n\n**Detection Requirements:**\n\nSystem SHOULD detect large files before processing:\n\n**Size Checking:**\n- Check file size before loading into memory\n- Define reasonable threshold (suggested: 100 MB)\n- If file exceeds threshold → Warn user\n\n**Handling Large Files:**\n- Binary files → Copy without loading into memory (streaming copy)\n- Text files → SHOULD attempt streaming if possible\n- Tag preservation → Skip for files exceeding threshold\n\n**User Notification:**\n- System SHOULD warn about potential memory issues for large files\n- System SHOULD ask for confirmation before processing large files\n\n**Contract:** System MUST NOT fail due to memory exhaustion from large files\n\n**Handling**:\n```\nWarning: Large file detected\nFile: docs/diagrams/large-architecture.png\nSize: 150 MB\nAction: Files over 100 MB may cause memory issues.\n        Binary files are copied without tag preservation.\n        Proceed? [y/N]\n```\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Update Tests\n\n**Test 1: Simple File Update**\n- Setup: Install WSD v1.0.0\n- Action: Update to v1.1.0 with modified task-master.md\n- Verify:\n  - File updated with new content\n  -

Major: Breaking changes (v1.0.0 -> v2.0.0)\n   - Minor: New features (v1.0.0 -> v1.1.0)\n   - Patch: Bug fixes (v1.0.0 -> v1.0.1)\n\n2. **Changelog**: Document changes clearly\n   ```markdown\n   # Changelog\n\n   ## v1.1.0 (2025-11-15)\n   - Added: new-feature-agent.md\n   - Updated: ws-init.md (new tag: deployment-config)\n   - Removed: deprecated-agent.md\n   - Fixed: Permission on health_check.py\n   ```\n\n3. **Tag Stability**: Don't remove tags unnecessarily\n   - Removing tags loses user content\n   - Add new tags for new features\n   - Deprecate in documentation if needed\n\n**File Management:**\n1. **Careful Deletions**: Removing files deletes user versions\n   ```\n   # Good: Deprecate in documentation\n   \"Note: old-agent.md is deprecated. Use new-agent.md instead.\"\n\n   # Bad: Delete without warning\n   ```\n\n2. **no_overwrite Usage**: Declare user-owned files in wsd.json\n   ```json\n   // In wsd.json:\n   {\n       \"version\": \"1.1.0\",\n       \"no_overwrite\": [\n           \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n           \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n           \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\",\n           \"config/local-settings.json\"\n       ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Executable Declaration**: Declare executable files in wsd.json\n   ```json\n   // In wsd.json:\n   {\n       \"version\": \"1.1.0\",\n       \"executable\": [\n           \"scripts/utility.sh\",\n           \"scripts/health_check.py\"\n       ]\n   }\n   ```\n\n### For Implementers\n\n**Atomic Operations:**\n1. **Validate First**: Check all preconditions before modifying files\n2. **Transaction-Like**: Group related operations\n3. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to undo changes\n4. **Logging**: Record all operations for debugging\n\n**Error Handling:**\n1. **Early Detection**: Catch errors before modifications\n2. **Clear Messages**: Provide actionable error information\n3. **Safe Defaults**: Prefer caution over aggressive behavior\n4. **Recovery Guidance**: Help users fix problems\n\n**Performance:**\n1. **Efficient Scanning**: Use appropriate data structures\n2. **Lazy Loading**: Don't load unnecessary files\n3. **Parallel Operations**: Where safe and beneficial\n4. **Progress Indication**: Show progress for long operations\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **System-Architecture.md**: High-level WSD architecture and component integration\n- **Template-System.md**: Tag syntax and preservation algorithm\n- **Installation-System.md**: Fresh installation process\n- **WSD-Manifest-Schema.md**: Detailed manifest format\n- **Install-And-Update-Overview.md**: Command-line interface\n- **Content-Hashing-Overview.md**: Hash calculation algorithm for file comparison\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the WSD Update System including update detection, file comparison, content preservation, dry-run functionality, and error handling.

In the WSD Development repository, this runtime is built in the `source/` directory, but end-users receive WSD Runtime as a standalone distribution.\n    28→\n    29→**In WSD Development Repository:**\n    30→```\n    31→wsd-development/\n    32→└── source/                    # Contains WSD Runtime (the product)\n    33→    ├── .claude/\n    34→    ├── dev/\n    35→    ├── docs/\n    36→    ├── scripts/\n    37→    └── wsd.py\n    38→```\n    39→\n    40→**WSD Runtime (Distributed to Users):**\n    41→```\n    42→wsd-runtime/                   # Standalone distribution\n    43→├── .claude/\n    44→├── dev/\n    45→├── docs/\n    46→├── scripts/\n    47→└── wsd.py\n    48→```\n    49→\n    50→**After Installation in User's Project:**\n    51→```\n    52→my-project/                    # User's project root\n    53→├── .claude/                   # Copied from WSD Runtime\n    54→├── dev/                       # Copied from WSD Runtime\n    55→├── docs/                      # Copied from WSD Runtime\n    56→├── scripts/                   # Copied from WSD Runtime\n    57→├── wsd.py                     # Copied from WSD Runtime\n    58→└── .wsd                       # Manifest created during installation\n    59→```\n    60→\n    61→For details on the complete directory structure, see the source/ directory in the WSD Development repository or System-Architecture.md.\n    62→\n    63→### File Categories\n    64→\n    65→**Configuration Files**\n    66→- **Location**: `.claude/`\n    67→- **Purpose**: Agent definitions, custom commands, hooks, and Claude Code settings\n    68→- **Update Behavior**: Updated with new features and improvements\n    69→- **Customization**: May contain WORKSCOPE-DEV tags for project-specific adjustments\n    70→\n    71→**Development Artifacts**\n    72→- **Location**: `dev/`\n    73→- **Purpose**: Temporary diagnostic files, work journals, workscope definitions, and other development artifacts\n    74→- **Update Behavior**: Directory structure maintained, contents user-generated\n    75→- **Special Note**: Empty subdirectories preserved via .wsdkeep files\n    76→\n    77→**Documentation Structure**\n    78→- **Location**: `docs/`\n    79→- **Purpose**: Core specifications, feature documentation, standards, tickets, and active working memory\n    80→- **Update Behavior**: Structure updated, user content in workbench preserved\n    81→- **Protection**: `read-only/` contents protected from agent modification\n    82→\n    83→**Script Files**\n    84→- **Location**: `scripts/`\n    85→- **Purpose**: Utility scripts including health checks, documentation generators, and initialization tools\n    86→- **Update Behavior**: Updated with bug fixes and enhancements\n    87→- **Special Handling**: Execute permissions preserved (declared in wsd.json)\n    88→\n    89→**Root Files**\n    90→- **Purpose**: Version control exclusions, licensing, and the WSD task runner\n    91→- **Update Behavior**: Updated with project evolution\n    92→\n    93→## .wsdkeep Placeholder Files\n    94→\n    95→### Purpose\n    96→\n    97→.wsdkeep files are structural artifacts that mark directories required by the WSD template. They serve as placeholders that maintain empty directory structures in both the filesystem and version control systems. Git doesn't track empty directories, so .wsdkeep files ensure the WSD directory structure is preserved across clones, forks, and distribution.\n    98→\n    99→### File Characteristics\n   100→\n   101→**Name**: Exactly `.wsdkeep` (no variations)\n   102→**Content**: Always empty (0 bytes)\n   103→**Location**: Any directory required by WSD that may be empty\n   104→**Visibility**: Hidden file (starts with dot)\n   105→\n   106→### Conceptual Model\n   107→\n   108→.wsdkeep files serve two distinct purposes at different stages of the WSD pipeline:\n   109→\n   110→**In WSD Runtime Source (source/ directory):**\n   111→- .wsdkeep files exist as git placeholders to maintain directory structure in version control\n   112→- They mark which directories WSD requires to exist\n   113→\n   114→**In wsd.json Metadata:**\n   115→- The `required_directories` field declares directories that must exist in target projects\n   116→- This field is populated by scanning for .wsdkeep files during pre-staging\n   117→- Directory paths are extracted from .wsdkeep file locations (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep` → `docs/workbench`)\n   118→\n   119→**In Target Projects:**\n   120→- .wsdkeep files are generated during installation based on directory state\n   121→- They are created only if the directory is empty (no other files exist)\n   122→- They maintain directory structure in the user's version control\n   123→\n   124→**Pipeline Flow:**\n   125→```\n   126→SOURCE                    MANIFEST                    TARGET\n   127→.wsdkeep in git    →     required_directories   →    .wsdkeep generated\n   128→(placeholder)            (semantic intent)           (if directory empty)\n   129→```\n   130→\n   131→**Key Distinction:**\n   132→- .wsdkeep files are **not content files** - they are structural artifacts\n   133→- They are **not tracked in file_hashes** - their presence is managed separately via `required_directories`\n   134→- They **never appear in the `.wsd` manifest** - manifest tracks content files only\n   135→\n   136→### Pre-Staging: Extracting required_directories\n   137→\n   138→During the pre-staging process, before distribution:\n   139→\n   140→1. `pre_staging.py` scans the WSD Runtime source for all `.wsdkeep` files\n   141→2. For each `.wsdkeep` file found, the parent directory path is extracted\n   142→3. These directory paths populate the `required_directories` array in `wsd.json`\n   143→4. The array is sorted for deterministic output and git-friendly diffs\n   144→5. `.wsdkeep` files are excluded from `file_hashes` generation\n   145→\n   146→**Example Extraction:**\n   147→```\n   148→Source files scanned:\n   149→  docs/workbench/.wsdkeep\n   150→  dev/diagnostics/.wsdkeep\n   151→  docs/tickets/open/.wsdkeep\n   152→\n   153→Extracted to wsd.json:\n   154→  \"required_directories\": [\n   155→    \"dev/diagnostics\",\n   156→    \"docs/tickets/open\",\n   157→    \"docs/workbench\"\n   158→  ]\n   159→```\n   160→\n   161→### Installation and Update: Processing required_directories\n   162→\n   163→During installation and updates, after all regular file operations complete:\n   164→\n   165→1. Read the `required_directories` array from the source `wsd.json`\n   166→2. For each directory in the array:\n   167→   - Ensure the directory exists in the target project (create if missing)\n   168→   - Evaluate using `_directory_needs_wsdkeep()` logic\n   169→   - Create `.wsdkeep` only if the directory is empty\n   170→\n   171→**Decision Logic (`_directory_needs_wsdkeep()`):**\n   172→```\n   173→- If directory does NOT exist → Create directory + .wsdkeep\n   174→- If directory exists but is empty → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n   175→- If directory contains only .wsdkeep → Preserve .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n   176→- If directory has other content → Skip .wsdkeep (content maintains structure)\n   177→```\n   178→\n   179→**Why After Regular Files**: Processing `required_directories` after regular file operations ensures correct decisions based on final directory state. For example, if an update deletes a file that was the only content in a directory, the directory correctly receives `.wsdkeep`. Conversely, if an update adds files to a directory, `.wsdkeep` is correctly skipped.\n   180→\n   181→### Manifest Exclusion\n   182→\n   183→.wsdkeep files are **never tracked in the `.wsd` manifest**. The manifest tracks content files only, not structural artifacts. Directory requirements are declarative (via `required_directories`) rather than tracked file-by-file.\n   184→\n   185→### Directory Requirements\n   186→\n   187→Any directory in the WSD template structure that is required but may be empty should contain a .wsdkeep file in the source.\n   188→\n   189→**Note on Specification Design:** This specification intentionally omits enumerating specific .wsdkeep file locations to prevent specification drift. The source/ directory structure serves as the Source of Truth for .wsdkeep placement, which evolves as the template system develops new organizational patterns. Common patterns include:\n   190→\n   191→- Archive subdirectories (for historical artifacts)\n   192→- Working directories (for temporary or active work)\n   193→- Organizational subdirectories (that organize content but start empty)\n   194→\n   195→### Version Control Integration\n   196→\n   197→**.wsdkeep Should Be Committed (in WSD Runtime Source)**:\n   198→- Ensures directory structure preserved in git\n   199→- Allows clone operations to recreate structure\n   200→- Standard practice for placeholder files\n   201→- Required for proper template distribution\n   202→\n   203→**.gitignore Interaction**:\n   204→- If directory is ignored, .wsdkeep may not be needed for git\n   205→- .wsdkeep still created for filesystem structure consistency\n   206→- Example: `dev/diagnostics/` might be gitignored, but .wsdkeep ensures directory exists\n   207→\n   208→**Distribution Benefits**:\n   209→- ZIP/tar archives preserve empty directories via .wsdkeep\n   210→- Web downloads include complete structure\n   211→- Package managers can maintain directory hierarchy\n   212→\n   213→### Examples\n   214→\n   215→**Example 1: Fresh Installation**\n   216→\n   217→The installation reads `required_directories` from `wsd.json` and creates `.wsdkeep` in empty directories:\n   218→\n   219→```\n   220→# wsd.json declares:\n   221→\"required_directories\": [\n   222→  \"dev/diagnostics\",\n   223→  \"dev/journal/archive\",\n   224→  \"docs/workbench\"\n   225→]\n   226→\n   227→# After installation:\n   228→project/\n   229→├── dev/\n   230→│   ├── diagnostics/\n   231→│   │   └── .wsdkeep         #

These functions are called during install and update operations.\n  1195→\n  1196→**Error Propagation:** Template System functions MUST raise exceptions (not return error codes or empty values) when errors occur. The calling install/update operation catches these exceptions to trigger rollback and display error messages.\n  1197→\n  1198→**For operation-level error handling**, see:\n  1199→- **Installation-System.md § Error Handling** (installation-specific errors and rollback)\n  1200→- **Update-System.md § Error Handling** (update-specific errors and rollback)\n  1201→\n  1202→## Implementation Requirements\n  1203→\n  1204→### Parser Requirements\n  1205→\n  1206→1. **Simple String Search**: Use basic string operations, not regex or XML parsing\n  1207→2. **Case Sensitive**: Tags must match exactly as specified\n  1208→3. **Preserve Formatting**: Don't modify whitespace or line endings\n  1209→4. **Handle UTF-8**: Support international characters in content\n  1210→\n  1211→### Performance Requirements\n  1212→\n  1213→1. **File Scanning**: O(n) where n is file size\n  1214→2. **Tag Extraction**: O(m) where m is number of tags\n  1215→3. **Memory Usage**: Full file loaded into memory\n  1216→4. **No Caching**: Fresh scan on each update\n  1217→\n  1218→### Self-Detection Prevention\n  1219→\n  1220→The WSD Runtime source code contains functions that search for WORKSCOPE-DEV tag patterns. Without special handling, the tag scanner would detect these search patterns as malformed tags when scanning `wsd.py` itself during updates.\n  1221→\n  1222→Two complementary techniques prevent this self-detection:\n  1223→\n  1224→**For Documentation Examples (Non-Breaking Hyphen)**\n  1225→\n  1226→Documentation files that show tag syntax examples use the non-breaking hyphen `‑` (U+2011) instead of the regular hyphen `-` (U+002D) in the \"WORKSCOPE-DEV\" portion.

This specification defines the template organization, the WORKSCOPE-DEV tag system for customizable content, and the rules governing content preservation during updates.\n\nFor broader architectural context and how the Template System integrates with other WSD components, see System-Architecture.md.\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Template System serves three critical functions:\n\n1. **Distribution**: Provides a complete set of files that implement the workscope workflow system\n2. **Customization**: Allows users to adapt WSD to their specific project needs\n3. **Preservation**: Maintains user customizations across WSD updates\n\nThis specification establishes the authoritative definition of template structure, tag syntax, preservation rules, and edge case handling.\n\n## Template File Organization\n\n### WSD Runtime Structure\n\nThe WSD Runtime is a self-contained directory containing all files that will be copied to user projects during installation. In the WSD Development repository, this runtime is built in the `source/` directory, but end-users receive WSD Runtime as a standalone distribution.\n\n**In WSD Development Repository:**\n```\nwsd-development/\n└── source/                    # Contains WSD Runtime (the product)\n    ├── .claude/\n    ├── dev/\n    ├── docs/\n    ├── scripts/\n    └── wsd.py\n```\n\n**WSD Runtime (Distributed to Users):**\n```\nwsd-runtime/                   # Standalone distribution\n├── .claude/\n├── dev/\n├── docs/\n├── scripts/\n└── wsd.py\n```\n\n**After Installation in User's Project:**\n```\nmy-project/                    # User's project root\n├── .claude/                   # Copied from WSD Runtime\n├── dev/                       # Copied from WSD Runtime\n├── docs/                      # Copied from WSD Runtime\n├── scripts/                   # Copied from WSD Runtime\n├── wsd.py                     # Copied from WSD Runtime\n└── .wsd                       # Manifest created during installation\n```\n\nFor details on the complete directory structure, see the source/ directory in the WSD Development repository or System-Architecture.md.\n\n### File Categories\n\n**Configuration Files**\n- **Location**: `.claude/`\n- **Purpose**: Agent definitions, custom commands, hooks, and Claude Code settings\n- **Update Behavior**: Updated with new features and improvements\n- **Customization**: May contain WORKSCOPE-DEV tags for project-specific adjustments\n\n**Development Artifacts**\n- **Location**: `dev/`\n- **Purpose**: Temporary diagnostic files, work journals, workscope definitions, and other development artifacts\n- **Update Behavior**: Directory structure maintained, contents user-generated\n- **Special Note**: Empty subdirectories preserved via .wsdkeep files\n\n**Documentation Structure**\n- **Location**: `docs/`\n- **Purpose**: Core specifications, feature documentation, standards, tickets, and active working memory\n- **Update Behavior**: Structure updated, user content in workbench preserved\n- **Protection**: `read-only/` contents protected from agent modification\n\n**Script Files**\n- **Location**: `scripts/`\n- **Purpose**: Utility scripts including health checks, documentation generators, and initialization tools\n- **Update Behavior**: Updated with bug fixes and enhancements\n- **Special Handling**: Execute permissions preserved (declared in wsd.json)\n\n**Root Files**\n- **Purpose**: Version control exclusions, licensing, and the WSD task runner\n- **Update Behavior**: Updated with project evolution\n\n## .wsdkeep Placeholder Files\n\n### Purpose\n\n.wsdkeep files are structural artifacts that mark directories required by the WSD template. They serve as placeholders that maintain empty directory structures in both the filesystem and version control systems. Git doesn't track empty directories, so .wsdkeep files ensure the WSD directory structure is preserved across clones, forks, and distribution.\n\n### File Characteristics\n\n**Name**: Exactly `.wsdkeep` (no variations)\n**Content**: Always empty (0 bytes)\n**Location**: Any directory required by WSD that may be empty\n**Visibility**: Hidden file (starts with dot)\n\n### Conceptual Model\n\n.wsdkeep files serve two distinct purposes at different stages of the WSD pipeline:\n\n**In WSD Runtime Source (source/ directory):**\n- .wsdkeep files exist as git placeholders to maintain directory structure in version control\n- They mark which directories WSD requires to exist\n\n**In wsd.json Metadata:**\n- The `required_directories` field declares directories that must exist in target projects\n- This field is populated by scanning for .wsdkeep files during pre-staging\n- Directory paths are extracted from .wsdkeep file locations (e.g., `docs/workbench/.wsdkeep` → `docs/workbench`)\n\n**In Target Projects:**\n- .wsdkeep files are generated during installation based on directory state\n- They are created only if the directory is empty (no other files exist)\n- They maintain directory structure in the user's version control\n\n**Pipeline Flow:**\n```\nSOURCE                    MANIFEST                    TARGET\n.wsdkeep in git    →     required_directories   →    .wsdkeep generated\n(placeholder)            (semantic intent)           (if directory empty)\n```\n\n**Key Distinction:**\n- .wsdkeep files are **not content files** - they are structural artifacts\n- They are **not tracked in file_hashes** - their presence is managed separately via `required_directories`\n- They **never appear in the `.wsd` manifest** - manifest tracks content files only\n\n### Pre-Staging: Extracting required_directories\n\nDuring the pre-staging process, before distribution:\n\n1. `pre_staging.py` scans the WSD Runtime source for all `.wsdkeep` files\n2. For each `.wsdkeep` file found, the parent directory path is extracted\n3. These directory paths populate the `required_directories` array in `wsd.json`\n4. The array is sorted for deterministic output and git-friendly diffs\n5. `.wsdkeep` files are excluded from `file_hashes` generation\n\n**Example Extraction:**\n```\nSource files scanned:\n  docs/workbench/.wsdkeep\n  dev/diagnostics/.wsdkeep\n  docs/tickets/open/.wsdkeep\n\nExtracted to wsd.json:\n  \"required_directories\": [\n    \"dev/diagnostics\",\n    \"docs/tickets/open\",\n    \"docs/workbench\"\n  ]\n```\n\n### Installation and Update: Processing required_directories\n\nDuring installation and updates, after all regular file operations complete:\n\n1. Read the `required_directories` array from the source `wsd.json`\n2. For each directory in the array:\n   - Ensure the directory exists in the target project (create if missing)\n   - Evaluate using `_directory_needs_wsdkeep()` logic\n   - Create `.wsdkeep` only if the directory is empty\n\n**Decision Logic (`_directory_needs_wsdkeep()`):**\n```\n- If directory does NOT exist → Create directory + .wsdkeep\n- If directory exists but is empty → Create .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n- If directory contains only .wsdkeep → Preserve .wsdkeep (maintains structure)\n- If directory has other content → Skip .wsdkeep (content maintains structure)\n```\n\n**Why After Regular Files**: Processing `required_directories` after regular file operations ensures correct decisions based on final directory state. For example, if an update deletes a file that was the only content in a directory, the directory correctly receives `.wsdkeep`. Conversely, if an update adds files to a directory, `.wsdkeep` is correctly skipped.\n\n### Manifest Exclusion\n\n.wsdkeep files are **never tracked in the `.wsd` manifest**. The manifest tracks content files only, not structural artifacts. Directory requirements are declarative (via `required_directories`) rather than tracked file-by-file.\n\n### Directory Requirements\n\nAny directory in the WSD template structure that is required but may be empty should contain a .wsdkeep file in the source.\n\n**Note on Specification Design:** This specification intentionally omits enumerating specific .wsdkeep file locations to prevent specification drift. The source/ directory structure serves as the Source of Truth for .wsdkeep placement, which evolves as the template system develops new organizational patterns. Common patterns include:\n\n- Archive subdirectories (for historical artifacts)\n- Working directories (for temporary or active work)\n- Organizational subdirectories (that organize content but start empty)\n\n### Version Control Integration\n\n**.wsdkeep Should Be Committed (in WSD Runtime Source)**:\n- Ensures directory structure preserved in git\n- Allows clone operations to recreate structure\n- Standard practice for placeholder files\n- Required for proper template distribution\n\n**.gitignore Interaction**:\n- If directory is ignored, .wsdkeep may not be needed for git\n- .wsdkeep still created for filesystem structure consistency\n- Example: `dev/diagnostics/` might be gitignored, but .wsdkeep ensures directory exists\n\n**Distribution Benefits**:\n- ZIP/tar archives preserve empty directories via .wsdkeep\n- Web downloads include complete structure\n- Package managers can maintain directory hierarchy\n\n### Examples\n\n**Example 1: Fresh Installation**\n\nThe installation reads `required_directories` from `wsd.json` and creates `.wsdkeep` in empty directories:\n\n```\n# wsd.json declares:\n\"required_directories\": [\n  \"dev/diagnostics\",\n  \"dev/journal/archive\",\n  \"docs/workbench\"\n]\n\n# After installation:\nproject/\n├── dev/\n│   ├── diagnostics/\n│   │   └── .wsdkeep         # Created (directory is empty)\n│   └── journal/\n│       └── archive/\n│           └── .wsdkeep     # Created (directory is empty)\n├── docs/\n│   └── workbench/\n│       └── .wsdkeep         # Created (directory is empty)\n└── .wsd                     # Manifest (does NOT list .wsdkeep files)\n```\n\n**Example 2: Installation into Directory with User Content**\n\nUser's project already has `docs/workbench/notes.md` before installation:\n\n```\n# wsd.json declares:\n\"required_directories\": [\"docs/workbench\", ...]\n\n# Before installation:\ndocs/workbench/\n└── notes.md                 # User's existing file\n\n# After installation:\ndocs/workbench/\n└── notes.md                 # Preserved, NO .wsdkeep added\n```\n\n**Explanation**: The `required_directories` processing finds user content in the directory, so `.wsdkeep` is skipped.\n\n**Example 3: Update Adds New Required Directory**\n\nA new WSD version adds `dev/experiments/` to `required_directories`:\n\n```\n# Updated wsd.json declares:\n\"required_directories\": [\n  \"dev/diagnostics\",\n  \"dev/experiments\",          # NEW\n  \"docs/workbench\"\n]\n\n# After update:\ndev/experiments/\n└── .wsdkeep                 # Created (new directory is empty)\n```\n\n**Example 4: Update When User Populated Directory**\n\nUser has populated `docs/workbench/` with their files:\n\n```\n# wsd.json declares:\n\"required_directories\": [\"docs/workbench\", ...]\n\n# User's directory state:\ndocs/workbench/\n├── my-analysis.md           # User's file\n└── notes.md                 # User's file\n\n# After update:\ndocs/workbench/\n├── my-analysis.md           # User's files preserved\n└── notes.md                 # NO .wsdkeep added (directory has content)\n```\n\n**Result**: No `.wsdkeep` created because user content maintains the directory.\n\n### Special Cases\n\n**Collision Detection**:\n- .wsdkeep files are explicitly excluded from collision detection\n- They can never cause installation collisions\n- See Installation-System.md for collision handling details\n\n**Manual Deletion**:\n- Safe to delete .wsdkeep from any directory\n- No system breakage if removed\n- Future updates will recreate .wsdkeep only if directory is empty\n\n**Binary Content**:\n- .wsdkeep must always be empty (0 bytes)\n- Any content makes it invalid as placeholder\n- Installation/update systems assume empty content\n\n### Design Philosophy\n\n**.wsdkeep serves a single purpose**: Mark required directories that may be empty.\n\n**Why Not Alternatives**:\n- Git doesn't track empty directories (fundamental limitation)\n- README files add clutter and maintenance burden\n- .gitkeep is not universally recognized\n- .wsdkeep clearly indicates purpose (WSD-specific)\n\n**Structural Artifact Approach**:\n- Always empty (no content to maintain)\n- Predictable name (no variations)\n- Safe to delete (no functional dependency)\n- Evaluated against target state (not blindly copied)\n- Never tracked in manifest (filtered at write time)\n\n### Special File Handling\n\n**Protected Directories**\n- **`docs/read-only/`**: All files protected from agent modification\n  - Enforcement: Via `protect_files.py` hook (provided by Claude Code)\n  - Update Behavior: Can be updated by WSD, not by agents\n- **`docs/references/`**: Template references protected from agent modification\n  - Similar protection as read-only\n\n## File Permission Model\n\n### Permission Declaration\n\nFile permissions in WSD are explicitly declared rather than implicitly inherited, ensuring correct permissions across all delivery mechanisms (git, web download, package managers).\n\n**Executable Files Declaration**:\n\nFiles requiring executable permission are declared in wsd.json metadata:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"no_overwrite\": [...],\n  \"executable\": [\n    \"scripts/health_check.py\",\n    \"scripts/update_docs.py\",\n    \"scripts/file_list.py\",\n    \"scripts/init_work_journal.sh\",\n    \".claude/hooks/protect_files.py\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**Location**: `wsd.json` at WSD Runtime root\n**Format**: Array of relative file paths (strings)\n**Scope**: Files that require executable (+x) permission\n\n**Note on Specification Design:** This specification intentionally omits enumerating all executable files to prevent specification drift. The wsd.json file in the source/ directory serves as the Source of Truth for the current executable list, which evolves as scripts are added, removed, or renamed in the template system\n\n### Why Explicit Declaration\n\nDifferent distribution mechanisms handle file permissions differently:\n\n**Git**: Preserves executable bit across clones and pulls\n**ZIP/tar downloads**: May lose permission information during archive extraction\n**Web fetch**: HTTP/HTTPS transfers don't include permission metadata\n**Package managers**: Implementation varies by system\n\nBy explicitly declaring executable files in wsd.json, WSD ensures correct permissions regardless of distribution method. The installation system reads this declaration and sets permissions appropriately.\n\n### Permission Application\n\n**During Installation**:\n- Standard files copied with source permissions via `shutil.copy2()`\n- After all files copied, read executable array from wsd.json\n- Set +x bit on all files in executable array\n- Permission setting is post-copy operation\n\n**During Updates**:\n- Updated files receive permissions from update source\n- Read executable array from UPDATE's wsd.json\n- Apply +x bit to files in executable list\n- Log permission changes for user visibility\n\n**Permission Setting Method**:\n```python\ndef set_executable(file_path):\n    \"\"\"Add executable permission to file.\"\"\"\n    current_mode = os.stat(file_path).st_mode\n    os.chmod(file_path, current_mode | 0o111)  # Add +x for user/group/other\n```\n\n### Conservative Approach\n\nWSD takes a conservative approach to permission management:\n\n**What We DO**:\n- Set executable bit (+x) for declared files\n- Preserve source permissions during file copy\n- Log permission changes during updates\n\n**What We DON'T DO**:\n- Remove executable bit from files\n- Modify other permission bits (read/write)\n- Apply full permission masks (e.g., forcing 755)\n- Change ownership or group\n\n**Rationale**:\n- Avoid interfering with user's permission preferences\n- Prevent edge cases from complex permission logic\n- Focus on essential requirement (executable scripts must execute)\n- Let OS and user manage other permission aspects\n\n### Common Executable Files\n\n**Shell Scripts**: `.sh` files in `scripts/` directory\n**Python Scripts**: `.py` files that serve as entry points or utilities\n**Hook Scripts**: `.claude/hooks/*.py` files for pre-execution hooks\n\n**Not All Scripts Need Execute Permission**:\n- Python modules imported by other scripts\n- Configuration files with `.py` extension\n- Scripts invoked via interpreter (e.g., `python script.py`)\n\nOnly scripts intended for direct execution should be in the executable array.\n\n### Examples\n\n**Example 1: Fresh Installation**\n\n```bash\n# After installation\n$ ls -l scripts/health_check.py\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 user  group  1234  Nov 12 12:00 scripts/health_check.py\n#  ^^^\n#  Executable bit set by installation system\n```\n\n**Example 2: Update Changes Permissions**\n\n```\nUpdate Report:\n...\nPermission Changes:\n  scripts/health_check.py: 644 -> 755 (now executable)\n  scripts/demo.sh: 644 -> 755 (now executable)\n```\n\nUser sees which files gained executable permission during update.\n\n### Operational Details\n\nFor implementation details, see:\n- **Installation-System.md § File Permission Handling** for installation process\n- **Update-System.md § File Permission Changes** for update handling\n\n## File Protection: no_overwrite Policy\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe no_overwrite policy protects user-owned files from being overwritten during WSD updates. This is distinct from WORKSCOPE-DEV tag preservation - no_overwrite applies to files where the user's customization IS the primary purpose (like Action-Plan.md which is the user's project plan), not files that merely contain customizable sections.\n\n### Declaration\n\nFiles requiring protection are declared in the source's wsd.json metadata file:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\",\n    \"dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md\",\n    \"config/local-settings.json\"\n  ],\n  \"executable\": [...]\n}\n```\n\n**Location**: `wsd.json` in the WSD Runtime\n**Format**: Array of relative file paths (strings)\n**Scope**: Applies during update operations only\n**Note**: The no_overwrite array typically protects multiple user-owned files, not just a single file\n\n### Policy vs. Storage: Source of Truth Principle\n\n**Critical Design Principle**: The UPDATE's wsd.json no_overwrite array is the authoritative source, not the installed manifest.\n\n**Why This Design**:\n- Template designer decides protection policy for each version\n- Protection policy may change between versions\n- Installed manifest is for tracking files, not defining policies\n- Allows protection to evolve with template updates\n\n**Example Evolution**:\n```json\n// Version 1.0.0 wsd.json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"config/local-settings.json\"\n  ]\n}\n\n// Version 1.1.0 wsd.json\n{\n  \"version\": \"1.1.0\",\n  \"no_overwrite\": [\n    \"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\",\n    \"config/local-settings.json\",\n    \"docs/core/PRD.md\"  // NEW: protected starting in v1.1.0\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nWhen user updates from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0, PRD.md becomes protected even though it wasn't protected in v1.0.0. The no_overwrite array evolves to protect additional files as the template system matures and user ownership patterns become clear.\n\n### Behavior\n\n**During Initial Installation**:\n- Protected files copied normally from template\n- No special handling required\n- Protection flag not stored in destination manifest\n- Files receive initial content from template\n\n**During Updates**:\n- System reads no_overwrite array from UPDATE's wsd.json\n- For each file in no_overwrite array:\n  - If file exists in target → Skip updating (preserve user's version)\n  - If file doesn't exist → Copy from template (protection applies to future updates)\n- Update operation logs which files were skipped\n- User version completely untouched\n\n### Examples\n\n**Example 1: User-Owned Documentation Files**\n\nThe no_overwrite array typically protects multiple user-owned files where customization IS the primary purpose:\n\n**File**: `docs/core/Action-Plan.md`\n**Why Protected**: This IS the user's project plan\n**Rationale**: Contains user-specific phases, tasks, and project structure\n\n```markdown\n# User's Action Plan (will be preserved)\n## Phase 1: Our Custom Foundation\n- [x] 1.1 - Setup our specific repository\n- [x] 1.2 - Configure our CI/CD pipeline\n- [ ] 1.3 - Write our project documentation\n```\n\n**File**: `docs/core/PRD.md`\n**Why Protected**: This IS the user's product requirements\n**Rationale**: Contains project-specific requirements, features, and specifications\n\n**File**: `dev/prompts/Developer-Notes.md`\n**Why Protected**: This IS the user's development notes\n**Rationale**: Contains team-specific development patterns and decisions\n\n**Behavior**: All no_overwrite files are never overwritten during updates once user has customized them\n\n### no_overwrite vs. WORKSCOPE-DEV Tags\n\nThese are complementary protection mechanisms with different purposes:\n\n| Aspect               | no_overwrite                         | WORKSCOPE-DEV Tags                                       |\n| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Protection Level** | Entire file                          | Specific sections                                        |\n| **Use Case**         | User-owned content                   | Customizable template sections                           |\n| **Behavior**         | Skip file entirely during updates    | Preserve tagged content, update surrounding template     |\n| **Example**          | Action-Plan.md (user's project plan) | ws-init.md project introduction section                  |\n| **When to Use**      | File content IS the user's work      | File is template with user customization points          |\n| **Update Impact**    | No template improvements received    | Template improvements received, customizations preserved |\n\n**Key Distinction**:\n- **no_overwrite**: \"This entire file belongs to the user\"\n- **WORKSCOPE-DEV tags**: \"This template has sections for user customization\"\n\n### Design Rationale\n\n**What Goes in no_overwrite** (files where customization IS the purpose):\n- User-owned documentation (Action-Plan.md, PRD.md, Developer-Notes.md)\n- Project-specific configuration files\n- Files that become the user's work product after customization\n\n**What DOESN'T Go in no_overwrite** (use WORKSCOPE-DEV tags instead):\n- Configuration files with customizable sections\n- Templates with project-specific content areas\n- Files that need template updates alongside customizations\n\n**Protection Philosophy**:\nThe no_overwrite list should be minimal and intentional. It declares files where:\n1. User customization is the PRIMARY purpose of the file\n2. Template updates would destroy the file's value\n3. Preserving user content is more important than template improvements\n\nFor most files with customizable content, WORKSCOPE-DEV tags provide better balance - they preserve customizations while allowing template improvements.\n\n## WSD Runtime Metadata (wsd.json)\n\nThe `wsd.json` file lives in WSD Runtime root and contains metadata about the WSD Runtime itself. This file is the authoritative source for WSD version, file protection policies, and executable file declarations.\n\n**Installation File Exclusion**: Certain files required for installation operations but not for WSD Runtime operation (including wsd.json and potentially other installation-only files) are **NOT** copied during installation. This design ensures the destination project contains only files necessary for operation. A side effect of this exclusion is that WSD-integrated projects cannot serve as installation sources, since they lack the installation-only files.\n\n**Purpose**:\n- Declares WSD Runtime version for tracking and compatibility\n- Defines file protection policies (no_overwrite list)\n- Declares executable file requirements (executable list)\n- Serves as Source of Truth for policies during update operations\n\n**File Location**: WSD Runtime root (e.g., `wsd-runtime/wsd.json`)\n\n**Note on Source of Truth**: The wsd.json file in the source/ directory is the single Source of Truth for current WSD Runtime version and protection policies. The executable bit of the files in the source/ directory are the Source of Truth for the file executable requirements. Version numbers shown in specification examples (e.g., \"1.0.0\", \"1.1.0\") are illustrative only and do not reflect current WSD Runtime version. The source/wsd.json file and the actual source/ directory structure are authoritative for current state.\n\nFor complete wsd.json specification including JSON schema, structure, field semantics, policy behavior, Source of Truth role, installation exclusion rule, validation rules, and examples, see **WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md**.\n\n## WORKSCOPE-DEV Tag System\n\n### Tag Purpose\n\nWORKSCOPE-DEV tags mark sections of template files where users are expected to add project-specific content. During updates, the content within these tags is preserved while the surrounding template is updated.\n\n### Tag Syntax\n\n#### Basic Structure\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-id>\nUser's custom content goes here\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n#### Complete Specification\n\n1. **Opening Tag**: `<WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-id>`\n   - Must start with `<WORKSCOPE-DEV`\n   - Followed by single space\n   - Followed by tag ID (no quotes)\n   - Closed with `>`\n\n2. **Content**: Any text between opening and closing tags\n   - Can span multiple lines\n   - Can contain any characters except the exact closing tag\n   - Whitespace and formatting preserved exactly\n\n3. **Closing Tag**: `</WORKSCOPE-DEV>`\n   - Must match exactly\n   - No tag ID in closing tag\n   - Must be on its own or at end of content\n\n#### Valid Examples\n\n**Single Line:**\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-name>MyAwesomeProject</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n**Multi-line:**\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-introduction>\n## PROJECT INTRODUCTION\n\nThis is MyAwesomeProject, a revolutionary solution for...\nWe use Claude Code to accelerate our development process.\n\nKey features include:\n- Feature A\n- Feature B\n- Feature C\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n**Inline in Markdown:**\n```markdown\nThe minimum Python version is <WORKSCOPE-DEV python-version>3.10</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n**In Code Comments:**\n```python\n# <WORKSCOPE-DEV authentication-note>\n# Our authentication uses OAuth2 with custom scopes.\n# See docs/auth-guide.md for implementation details.\n# </WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n### Tag ID Conventions\n\n#### Naming Rules\n\n1. **Format**: kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)\n2. **Length**: 3-50 characters\n3. **Characters**: `a-z`, `0-9`, and `-` only\n4. **Start/End**: Must start and end with alphanumeric\n\n#### Naming Patterns\n\n**By Purpose:**\n- Configuration: `*-config`, `*-settings`\n- Documentation: `*-introduction`, `*-description`, `*-notes`\n- Requirements: `*-version`, `*-dependencies`\n- Project-specific: `project-*`, `app-*`, `system-*`\n\n**By Scope:**\n- Global: `project-*`, `system-*`\n- Feature-specific: `feature-*`, `module-*`\n- Tool-specific: `python-*`, `typescript-*`, `docker-*`\n\n#### Standard Tag IDs\n\nWSD Runtime includes WORKSCOPE-DEV tags across template files in the source/ directory, including (but not limited to) command definitions, agent rules, and configuration files. These tags enable users to customize project-specific content while preserving their customizations across WSD updates.\n\n**For the authoritative catalog of all tags**, including:\n- Complete list of tag IDs with purposes and locations\n- Detailed context and usage guidelines for each tag\n- Initial content and user customization patterns\n- Tag naming conventions and patterns\n- Content guidelines by category\n- Tag lifecycle evolution\n\nSee: **Tag-Registry.md**\n\n**Note on Specification Design:** This specification intentionally omits enumerating specific tag IDs and counts to prevent specification drift. Tag-Registry.md serves as the Source of Truth for the current tag catalog, which evolves as the WSD Runtime template system develops\n\n### Tag Constraints\n\n1. **No Nesting**: Tags cannot be nested within other tags\n2. **Unique IDs per File**: Same tag ID should not appear twice in one file\n3. **No Partial Tags**: Opening and closing tags must both be present\n4. **No Tag Modification**: Tag syntax must remain exact for parsing\n\n## Content Preservation Algorithm\n\n### Overview\n\nThe content preservation algorithm ensures user customizations survive WSD updates. It operates through simple string manipulation rather than complex parsing.\n\n### Algorithm Steps\n\n```python\ndef preserve_content(update_file, destination_file):\n    \"\"\"\n    Preserve user customizations during update.\n\n    Args:\n        update_file: New template file from WSD\n        destination_file: Existing file in user's project\n\n    Returns:\n        Updated content with preserved customizations\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Step 1: Read update file\n    update_content = read_file(update_file)\n\n    # Step 2: Find all WORKSCOPE-DEV tags in update\n    update_tags = find_all_tags(update_content)\n\n    # Step 3: If destination exists, extract user content\n    if exists(destination_file):\n        destination_content = read_file(destination_file)\n        preserved_content = {}\n\n        for tag_id in update_tags:\n            user_content = extract_tag_content(destination_content, tag_id)\n            if user_content is not None:\n                preserved_content[tag_id] = user_content\n    else:\n        preserved_content = {}\n\n    # Step 4: Copy update content as base\n    result_content = update_content\n\n    # Step 5: Replace tag contents with preserved content\n    for tag_id, content in preserved_content.items():\n        result_content = replace_tag_content(result_content, tag_id, content)\n\n    # Step 6: Write result\n    write_file(destination_file, result_content)\n```\n\n### Detailed Preservation Rules\n\n#### Rule 1: Exact Content Preservation\nUser content between tags is preserved byte-for-byte, including:\n- Whitespace and indentation\n- Line endings\n- Special characters\n- Empty lines\n\n#### Rule 2: Context Updates\nThe template around tags can change completely:\n```xml\n<!-- Before Update -->\nPlease provide your <WORKSCOPE-DEV project-name>OldProject</WORKSCOPE-DEV> details.\n\n<!-- After Update -->\nProject Name: <WORKSCOPE-DEV project-name>OldProject</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\nConfiguration for the above project...\n```\n\n#### Rule 3: New Tags\nTags that don't exist in destination use initial content from update:\n```xml\n<!-- Update file (new tag) -->\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV deployment-region>us-west-2</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\n<!-- Destination file (tag doesn't exist) -->\n<!-- Result: us-west-2 is used as initial value -->\n```\n\n#### Rule 4: Removed Tags\nTags in destination but not in update are effectively removed:\n```xml\n<!-- Destination has tag that update doesn't -->\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV obsolete-feature>old content</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n<!-- Result: Entire tag and content removed -->\n```\n\n#### Rule 5: No Cross-File Preservation\nTags are file-specific. Same tag ID in different files treated independently.\n\n### Preservation Examples\n\n#### Example 1: Simple Content Preservation\n\n**Update File:**\n```markdown\n# Project Setup\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-introduction>\nDescribe your project here\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\n## Requirements\n- Python 3.10+\n```\n\n**Destination File (Before):**\n```markdown\n# Project Setup\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-introduction>\nMyProject is a web application for managing inventories.\nIt uses Django and PostgreSQL with real-time updates.\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\n## Requirements\n- Python 3.8+\n```\n\n**Destination File (After):**\n```markdown\n# Project Setup\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-introduction>\nMyProject is a web application for managing inventories.\nIt uses Django and PostgreSQL with real-time updates.\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\n## Requirements\n- Python 3.10+\n```\n\n#### Example 2: Multiple Tags\n\n**Update File:**\n```python\n# Configuration\nPROJECT = \"<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-name>YourProject</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\nVERSION = \"<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-version>1.0.0</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\nDEBUG = False  # Updated default\n```\n\n**Destination File (Before):**\n```python\n# Settings\nPROJECT = \"<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-name>SuperApp</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\nVERSION = \"<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-version>2.5.3</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\nDEBUG = True  # Old default\n```\n\n**Destination File (After):**\n```python\n# Configuration\nPROJECT = \"<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-name>SuperApp</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\nVERSION = \"<WORKSCOPE-DEV project-version>2.5.3</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\nDEBUG = False  # Updated default\n```\n\n#### Example 3: New Tag with Initial Content\n\n**Update File:**\n```yaml\n# <WORKSCOPE-DEV docker-config>\n# Docker configuration\n# Uncomment and modify as needed:\n# DOCKER_REGISTRY: ghcr.io\n# DOCKER_NAMESPACE: myorg\n# </WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n**Destination File (Before):**\n```yaml\n# (This section doesn't exist)\n```\n\n**Destination File (After):**\n```yaml\n# <WORKSCOPE-DEV docker-config>\n# Docker configuration\n# Uncomment and modify as needed:\n# DOCKER_REGISTRY: ghcr.io\n# DOCKER_NAMESPACE: myorg\n# </WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n## Edge Cases\n\n### Malformed Tags\n\n#### Missing Closing Tag\n**Behavior**: Tag ignored, content treated as regular template text\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV incomplete-tag>\nThis content has no closing tag...\nrest of file...\n```\n**Result**: Entire content from update file copied as-is\n\n#### Missing Opening Tag\n**Behavior**: Closing tag treated as regular text\n```xml\nSome content...\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n**Result**: Text copied as-is\n\n#### Mismatched Tag IDs\n**Behavior**: Opening tag without matching close treated as malformed\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-one>\nContent here\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-two>\nOther content\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n**Result**: Undefined behavior, likely malformed tag handling\n\n#### Nested Tags\n**Behavior**: Not supported, inner tags treated as content\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV outer-tag>\nSome content\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV inner-tag>\nNested content\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\nMore content\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n**Result**: Inner tag becomes part of outer tag's content\n\n### Special Characters in Content\n\n#### XML/HTML-like Content\n**Allowed**: User content can contain angle brackets\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV code-example>\nfunction example() {\n    if (x < y && y > z) {\n        return <div>Result</div>;\n    }\n}\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n\n#### Tag-like Text\n**Caution**: Content that looks like WORKSCOPE-DEV tags\n```xml\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV documentation>\nTo create a tag, use <WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-id>content</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\nNote: The above is just example text\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n```\n**Result**: First `</WORKSCOPE-DEV>` ends the tag prematurely\n\n### File-Level Edge Cases\n\n#### Binary Files\n**Behavior**: Binary files not scanned for tags\n**Detection**: By file extension or content analysis\n**Result**: Simple file copy during update\n\n#### Very Large Files\n**Behavior**: Entire file loaded into memory\n**Limitation**: System memory constraints apply\n**Mitigation**: Templates typically small text files\n\n#### Symlinks\n**Behavior**: Follow symlinks for reading\n**Creation**: Don't create new symlinks\n**Update**: Replace symlink with regular file\n\n#### Permission Errors\n**Read Error**: Update fails with clear message\n**Write Error**: Update fails with permission details\n**Recovery**: No partial updates (atomic operation)\n\n## Error Handling\n\n### Fundamental Principle: All Errors Are Fatal\n\n**Per Design Decision 12**: During install and update operations, ALL errors MUST halt the operation immediately. There is no distinction between \"fatal\" and \"non-fatal\" errors. Any error—whether a read error, write error, encoding error, permission error, or malformed tag—MUST raise an exception and abort the operation.\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Users must trust that \"success\" means complete success with no data loss\n- Operations are idempotent; users can fix issues and retry at minimal cost\n- Silent continuation erodes confidence and may hide systemic problems\n- Any anomaly may indicate a larger problem worth investigating\n- Git provides rollback; the system's job is to not make the mess bigger\n\n**Key Guarantees:**\n- No partial updates committed on any error\n- State remains consistent even on error (atomic operation)\n- Clear error messages enable users to fix issues and retry\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### 1. Tag Parsing Errors\n\nAll tag parsing errors during install/update operations MUST halt the operation immediately.\n\n**Missing Closing Tag:**\n```\nError: Malformed WORKSCOPE-DEV tag in .claude/commands/custom.md at line 45\nIssue: Opening tag 'project-config' has no matching closing tag\n\nOperation halted. No files have been modified.\nFix the tag syntax and retry the operation.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Fix tag syntax in source file, re-run operation\n\n---\n\n**Invalid Tag ID:**\n```\nError: Malformed WORKSCOPE-DEV tag in docs/core/config.md at line 23\nIssue: Invalid tag ID 'my tag' (expected kebab-case, 3-50 chars)\n\nOperation halted. No files have been modified.\nFix the tag ID format and retry the operation.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Fix tag ID to use valid kebab-case format\n\n---\n\n**Nested Tags:**\n```\nError: Nested WORKSCOPE-DEV tags detected in .claude/agents/custom.md\nOuter Tag: configuration (line 40)\nInner Tag: sub-config (line 45)\n\nOperation halted. No files have been modified.\nRestructure tags to avoid nesting and retry.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Restructure file to avoid nested tags\n\n#### 2. File Read Errors\n\nAll file read errors during install/update operations MUST halt the operation immediately.\n\n**Permission Denied:**\n```\nError: Cannot read file during operation\nFile: /path/to/template-file.md\nReason: Permission denied\n\nOperation halted. No files have been modified.\nGrant read permission: chmod u+r /path/to/template-file.md\nThen retry the operation.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Grant read permissions, retry operation\n\n---\n\n**Encoding Error:**\n```\nError: Cannot read file during operation\nFile: /path/to/destination-file.md\nReason: File is not valid UTF-8 encoded\n\nOperation halted. No files have been modified.\nConvert file to UTF-8 encoding and retry the operation.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Convert file to UTF-8 encoding, retry operation\n\n---\n\n**File Not Found (when expected):**\n```\nError: Cannot read file during operation\nFile: /path/to/expected-file.md\nReason: File not found\n\nOperation halted. No files have been modified.\nEnsure file exists at the expected location and retry.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Ensure file exists, retry operation\n\n#### 3. File Write Errors\n\nAll file write errors during install/update operations MUST halt the operation immediately with rollback.\n\n**Permission Denied:**\n```\nError: Cannot write file during operation\nFile: /path/to/destination-file.md\nReason: Permission denied\n\nOperation halted. All changes have been rolled back.\nGrant write permission: chmod u+w /path/to/destination-file.md\nThen retry the operation.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, triggers rollback, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Grant write permissions, retry operation\n\n---\n\n**Disk Full:**\n```\nError: Cannot write file during operation\nFile: /path/to/destination-file.md\nReason: No space left on device\n\nOperation halted. All changes have been rolled back.\nFree disk space and retry the operation.\n```\n\n**Behavior:** Operation halts immediately, triggers rollback, raises exception\n\n**Recovery:** Free disk space, retry operation\n\n#### 4. Binary File Handling\n\nBinary files are detected and handled without tag scanning. This is expected behavior, not an error.\n\n**Detection:** Files are identified as binary by extension or content analysis\n\n**Behavior:** Binary files copied directly without tag preservation (simple file copy)\n\n**Note:** This is the correct handling for binary files and does not constitute an error condition.\n\n### Error Message Requirements\n\nAll error messages MUST include:\n1. **What happened**: Clear description of error type\n2. **Where it happened**: File path and line number (where applicable)\n3. **Why it happened**: Specific reason (permission denied, encoding error, malformed tag, etc.)\n4. **Operation status**: Confirmation that operation halted and no partial changes committed\n5. **How to fix**: Actionable resolution steps including specific commands\n\n### Integration with Install/Update Operations\n\nThis section specifies error handling for the Template System's tag parsing and content preservation functions. These functions are called during install and update operations.\n\n**Error Propagation:** Template System functions MUST raise exceptions (not return error codes or empty values) when errors occur. The calling install/update operation catches these exceptions to trigger rollback and display error messages.\n\n**For operation-level error handling**, see:\n- **Installation-System.md § Error Handling** (installation-specific errors and rollback)\n- **Update-System.md § Error Handling** (update-specific errors and rollback)\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### Parser Requirements\n\n1. **Simple String Search**: Use basic string operations, not regex or XML parsing\n2. **Case Sensitive**: Tags must match exactly as specified\n3. **Preserve Formatting**: Don't modify whitespace or line endings\n4. **Handle UTF-8**: Support international characters in content\n\n### Performance Requirements\n\n1. **File Scanning**: O(n) where n is file size\n2. **Tag Extraction**: O(m) where m is number of tags\n3. **Memory Usage**: Full file loaded into memory\n4. **No Caching**: Fresh scan on each update\n\n### Self-Detection Prevention\n\nThe WSD Runtime source code contains functions that search for WORKSCOPE-DEV tag patterns. Without special handling, the tag scanner would detect these search patterns as malformed tags when scanning `wsd.py` itself during updates.\n\nTwo complementary techniques prevent this self-detection:\n\n**For Documentation Examples (Non-Breaking Hyphen)**\n\nDocumentation files that show tag syntax examples use the non-breaking hyphen `‑` (U+2011) instead of the regular hyphen `-` (U+002D) in the \"WORKSCOPE-DEV\" portion. This renders identically but prevents scanner detection. See **Tag-Registry.md § Writing Tag Examples in Documentation** for details.\n\n**For Source Code (String Concatenation)**\n\nSource code that searches for tag patterns uses string concatenation to construct the search string at runtime:\n\n```python\n# Pattern hidden from scanner via concatenation\n_TAG_OPEN_PREFIX = \"<\" + \"WORKSCOPE-DEV\"\n_TAG_CLOSE = \"</\" + \"WORKSCOPE-DEV>\"\n\n# Used in scanning functions\nstart = content.find(_TAG_OPEN_PREFIX, pos)\n```\n\nThe concatenated string `\"<\" + \"WORKSCOPE-DEV\"` produces the runtime value `<WORKSCOPE-DEV` but never appears as a literal pattern in the source file. Python optimizes string literal concatenation at compile time, so there is no performance impact.\n\n**When to Use Each Technique**\n\n| Context | Technique | Example |\n|---------|-----------|---------|\n| Documentation examples | Non-breaking hyphen | `<WORKSCOPE‑DEV tag-id>` |\n| Source code search patterns | String concatenation | `\"<\" + \"WORKSCOPE-DEV\"` |\n| Actual tags for preservation | Regular hyphen | `<WORKSCOPE-DEV tag-id>` |\n\n## Validation\n\n### Tag Validation Rules\n\n1. **Syntax Check**: Verify opening and closing tag format\n2. **ID Format**: Validate kebab-case convention\n3. **No Nesting**: Ensure tags don't nest\n4. **Completeness**: Verify all opened tags are closed\n\n### Content Validation Rules\n\n1. **Encoding**: Verify UTF-8 encoding\n2. **Size Limits**: Warn if file exceeds reasonable size\n3. **Binary Detection**: Skip binary files\n4. **Line Endings**: Preserve original line endings\n\n## Testing Scenarios\n\n### Basic Preservation Tests\n\n1. **Single Tag**: Preserve content in single tag\n2. **Multiple Tags**: Preserve multiple tags in one file\n3. **Empty Content**: Preserve empty tag content\n4. **Large Content**: Preserve multi-page content\n5. **Special Characters**: Preserve Unicode and symbols\n\n### Update Scenario Tests\n\n1. **Context Change**: Template changes around preserved content\n2. **Tag Addition**: New tags added in update\n3. **Tag Removal**: Tags removed in update\n4. **Tag Reorder**: Tags appear in different order\n5. **Initial Content**: New tag with default content\n\n### Edge Case Tests\n\n1. **Malformed Tag**: Missing closing tag\n2. **Nested Attempt**: Tag within tag\n3. **Similar Text**: Content that looks like tags\n4. **Binary File**: Non-text file handling\n5. **Permission Denied**: File not readable/writable\n\n### Integration Tests\n\n1. **Full Installation**: Fresh install with tags\n2. **Full Update**: Update with preservation\n3. **Multiple Files**: Tags across many files\n4. **Directory Tree**: Complete template structure\n5. **Rollback**: Revert using version control\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### For Template Designers\n\n1. **Meaningful IDs**: Use descriptive tag IDs\n2. **Documentation**: Comment tags purpose\n3. **Initial Content**: Provide helpful defaults\n4. **Consistent Naming**: Follow kebab-case convention\n5. **Unique IDs**: Ensure tag IDs are unique per file\n\n### For Users\n\n1. **Regular Updates**: Keep WSD current\n2. **Version Control**: Commit before updates\n3. **Review Changes**: Check preserved content after update\n4. **Report Issues**: Notify about malformed tags\n5. **Backup Strategy**: Maintain backups before major updates\n\n### For Implementers\n\n1. **Simple Algorithm**: Avoid complex parsing\n2. **Clear Errors**: Provide actionable error messages\n3. **Atomic Updates**: All or nothing operations\n4. **Preserve Exactly**: Don't modify user content\n5. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive edge case testing\n\n## Related Specifications\n\n- **System-Architecture.md**: High-level WSD architecture and component integration\n- **Installation-System.md**: How templates are installed\n- **Update-System.md**: How templates are updated\n- **Install-And-Update-Overview.md**: Command-line interface for install and update commands\n- **WSD-Manifest-Schema.md**: How files are tracked\n- **Tag-Registry.md**: Complete list of all tags\n\n---\n\n*This specification defines the authoritative rules for the WSD Template System including file organization, WORKSCOPE-DEV tags, content preservation, and edge case handling. All implementations must conform to these specifications.*\n","numLines":1339,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1339}}}

Common examples include wsd.json itself (which contains installation metadata but has no operational role in the destination) and system files like .DS_Store.\n101-\n102-**Path Requirements**:\n103-- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n104-- Forward slashes only\n105-- Files do NOT need to exist in WSD Runtime (they may be generated at build time)\n106-\n107:**Note**: Unlike no_overwrite and executable arrays, installation_only paths are not validated for existence. This allows declaring build-time generated files (e.g., `__init__.py` for PyPI packages) that should be excluded from installation. For exclusion mechanism implementation, see Installation-System.md § File Copying Process and the FIP in Install-And-Update-Overview.md.\n108-\n109-### no_overwrite\n110-\n111-**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n112-**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n113-**Example**: `[\"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\"]`\n114-\n115-**Purpose**: Declares which files should never be overwritten during updates when they exist in target.\n116-\n117-**Usage**: Files where user customization IS the primary purpose (like Action-Plan.md which IS the user's project plan). For files with customizable sections, use WORKSCOPE-DEV tags instead.\n--\n159-- `:` is a separator character\n160-- `<hex_digest>` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (256 bits / 4 bits per hex char)\n161-\n162-**Path Requirements**:\n163-- Keys are relative paths from WSD Runtime root\n164-- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n165-- Must match the path format used elsewhere in wsd.json\n166-\n167-**Which Files Are Hashed**:\n168-- All files that are copied during installation receive hashes\n169:- Files listed in the `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (they are not copied to destination)\n170-- The `.wsdignore` file (if present) is NOT hashed (excluded from staging)\n171-\n172-**Usage**: Hashes are generated during the pre-staging process by `pre_staging.py` and written to wsd.json before distribution. During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n173-\n174-**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n175-\n176-### required_directories\n177-\n178-**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n179-**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n--\n198-- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n199-- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n200-- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n201-\n202-**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n203-\n204-## Key Concepts\n205-\n206-**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest.

Common examples include wsd.json itself (which contains installation metadata but has no operational role in the destination) and system files like .DS_Store.\n101-\n102-**Path Requirements**:\n103-- Relative to WSD Runtime root\n104-- Forward slashes only\n105-- Files do NOT need to exist in WSD Runtime (they may be generated at build time)\n106-\n107:**Note**: Unlike no_overwrite and executable arrays, installation_only paths are not validated for existence. This allows declaring build-time generated files (e.g., `__init__.py` for PyPI packages) that should be excluded from installation. For exclusion mechanism implementation, see Installation-System.md § File Copying Process and the FIP in Install-And-Update-Overview.md.\n108-\n109-### no_overwrite\n110-\n111-**Type**: Array of strings (relative file paths)\n112-**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n113-**Example**: `[\"docs/core/Action-Plan.md\"]`\n114-\n115-**Purpose**: Declares which files should never be overwritten during updates when they exist in target.\n116-\n117-**Usage**: Files where user customization IS the primary purpose (like Action-Plan.md which IS the user's project plan). For files with customizable sections, use WORKSCOPE-DEV tags instead.\n--\n159-- `:` is a separator character\n160-- `<hex_digest>` is exactly 64 lowercase hexadecimal characters (256 bits / 4 bits per hex char)\n161-\n162-**Path Requirements**:\n163-- Keys are relative paths from WSD Runtime root\n164-- Forward slashes only (Unix-style)\n165-- Must match the path format used elsewhere in wsd.json\n166-\n167-**Which Files Are Hashed**:\n168-- All files that are copied during installation receive hashes\n169:- Files listed in the `installation_only` array are NOT hashed (they are not copied to destination)\n170-- The `.wsdignore` file (if present) is NOT hashed (excluded from staging)\n171-\n172-**Usage**: Hashes are generated during the pre-staging process by `pre_staging.py` and written to wsd.json before distribution. During install and update operations, target file hashes are calculated on-the-fly and compared against these stored source hashes. For detailed behavior, see Content-Hashing-Overview.md.\n173-\n174-**Note on .wsdkeep Files**: `.wsdkeep` placeholder files are NOT included in file_hashes. These files indicate directory requirements and are handled separately via the `required_directories` field. The pre-staging script extracts directory paths from `.wsdkeep` file locations and populates `required_directories`, while excluding `.wsdkeep` files from hash generation.\n175-\n176-### required_directories\n177-\n178-**Type**: Array of strings (relative directory paths)\n179-**Required**: No (defaults to empty array)\n--\n198-- Tracking them in `file_hashes` was conceptually incorrect (they have no meaningful content to hash)\n199-- This semantic approach clearly separates \"directories that must exist\" from \"files with content\"\n200-- Enables the install/update system to generate `.wsdkeep` files at the target rather than copying them\n201-\n202-**Note**: For how `required_directories` is consumed during installation and updates, see Installation-System.md and Update-System.md.\n203-\n204-## Key Concepts\n205-\n206-**Policy Source of Truth**: UPDATE's wsd.json is authoritative for policies during update operations, not the installed manifest.

Feature is Already Substantially Implemented (STATUS DRIFT)**\n\nThe FIP describes work that appears to be **already completed**. Specifically:\n\n- **Phase 1 (collect_wsd_files)**: Already implemented in `source/scripts/wsd_utils.py` (lines 907-1007). Both `pre_staging.py` and `stage_release.py` already import and use this function.\n\n- **Phase 2 (pre_staging.py enhancements)**: Already implemented. The current `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` (898 lines) already:\n  - Generates `file_hashes` (excluding `installation_only` and `.wsdkeep`)\n  - Syncs `executable` list from file permissions\n  - Extracts `required_directories` from `.wsdkeep` files\n  - Validates `no_overwrite` exists\n  - Validates manifest exclusivity\n  - Auto-increments version on changes\n\n- **Phase 3 (stage_release.py integration)**: Already implemented. Current `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` already uses `collect_wsd_files()` for validation before staging (lines 569-577).\n\n- **Phase 4 (Documentation)**: Would need verification, but much documentation exists.\n\nThe FIP's checkboxlist shows all items as `[ ]` (unaddressed), but the code clearly shows this work has been done.\n\n**2. FIP References Non-Existent Task Numbers**\n\nThe FIP's \"Relationship to Other Work\" section references:\n- \"Task 11.7 in Action-Plan.md\" - This IS correct\n- \"Pre-Staging Script Feature (Task 11.6)\" - Correct\n- \"Content Hashing Feature (Task 11.5)\" - Correct\n\nHowever, the actual Action-Plan.md shows:\n```\n- [x] **11.5** - Add content hashing...\n- [x] **11.6** - Create pre_staging.py script...\n- [ ] **11.7** - Create manifest-driven pipeline...\n```\n\nTasks 11.5 and 11.6 are **already complete** `[x]`, which confirms this feature's prerequisites are done, but raises the question: why is 11.7 still `[ ]` if the work is implemented?\n\n**3. Potential Orphaned/Stale Feature Spec**\n\nThis FIP may be a stale document that describes work that was implemented but the checkboxes were never updated. The actual implementations exist in:\n- `source/scripts/wsd_utils.py` - `collect_wsd_files()` function\n- `dev/scripts/pre_staging.py` - Full pre-staging script\n- `dev/scripts/stage_release.py` - Full staging script\n\n**4. Minor Inconsistency in \"Phase 1\" Description**\n\nThe FIP says Phase 1 task 1.1 is to \"Move `collect_wsd_files()` from `stage_release.py`\", but looking at the current code:\n- `collect_wsd_files()` is **already in** `source/scripts/wsd_utils.py`\n- `stage_release.py` **already imports it** from there (line 27)\n- `pre_staging.py` **already imports it** from there (line 31)\n\nThis suggests the move happened, but was never tracked.\n\n**5. Verification Path is Clear**\n\nTo confirm implementation status, we could:\n- Run `uv run dev/scripts/pre_staging.py --dry-run` and verify it produces expected output\n- Run `uv run dev/scripts/stage_release.py --dry-run` and verify it uses `collect_wsd_files`\n- Check test coverage in `tests/test_pre_staging.py` and `tests/test_stage_release.py`\n\n---\n\n### RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n1. **Investigation 1**: Verify implementation completeness by running both scripts with `--dry-run` and confirming they behave as the FIP describes.\n\n2. **If Implementation is Complete**: \n   - Update the FIP checkboxlist to mark completed items `[x]`\n   - Update Action-Plan.md task 11.7 to `[x]`\n   - Consider archiving or closing this Feature Overview\n\n3. **If Implementation is Partial**:\n   - Identify which specific tasks remain\n   - Update the FIP to reflect accurate current state\n\n4. **Documentation Audit**: Verify that the documentation updates described in Phase 4 were completed (Feature Brief archival, spec updates, etc.).\n\n---\n\nWhat would you like to do? Should we:\n1. Run an investigation to confirm implementation status?\n2. Proceed with updating the FIP based on current findings?\n3.
