Do not skip or skim these sections - they contain the most important customized instructions for this specific project. **Follow the instructions and rules within them.**\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/wsd:init [--custom | workscope-directive]\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `--custom` instructs the agent to skip Task-Master assignment and return to the User for a custom workscope\n- `workscope-directive` is a message forwarded to Task-Master to guide workscope selection\n\nThese options are mutually exclusive. Most common usage is simply `/wsd:init` with no arguments.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n/wsd:init\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init Do all of Phase 5, but not Phase 6\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init --custom\n```\n\n---\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV wsd-init-project-introduction>\n\nThis is the \"Phantom Reads Investigation\" project: a `git` repository intended for publishing on GitHub that provides an experiment to reproduce Claude Code Issue #17407 (\"Phantom Reads\"). The issue can be viewed publicly at: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17407`. Users can clone this repository to read more about the issue, its discovery, and to reproduce the issue on their own machines.\n\nPlease read:\n- `docs/core/PRD.md`\n- `docs/core/Experiment-Methodology.md`\n- `docs/core/Action-Plan.md`\n\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\nFirst Directive: Print a message acknowledging that you read the content in the `wsd-init-project-introduction` section immediately above and followed all directions therein.\n\n## Workscope System\n\nRun the `/wsd:boot` command to read the necessary files for understanding the Workscope-Dev Platform. When it is complete, return here and finish the remaining instructions.\n\n## Workscope ID Generation\n\nGenerate a unique Workscope ID for this session based on the current timestamp:\n\n1. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp\n2. Report your Workscope ID, which is derived from this timestamp according to the pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n\n**Remember this Workscope ID** as you will use it throughout your session for:\n- Work Journal naming\n- Workscope file naming (if fetching from Task-Master)\n- All agent communications\n\n## Work Journal\n\nYour next preparation task is to start a new \"Work Journal\" for YOUR fresh session with the Workscope ID:\n\n**CRITICAL - Work Journal in Archive Location:**\n\nRun the Work Journal initialization script, substituting your Workscope ID in the command below. Note that `[Workscope ID]` is strictly the `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` identifier, with no added prefix or suffix:\n\n(bash):\n   bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh \"[Workscope ID]\"\n\nThis script will create a new Work Journal directly in the archive location at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`. Verify that this file exists and was properly formed (with the correct filename).\n\nThis file is now YOUR \"Work Journal,\" and you will be continually adding to it over the course of YOUR session as you proceed through your workscope. Be sure to update your Work Journal after each step so this real time monitoring can take place.\n\n**CRITICAL**: `cat >> file << EOF` IS FORBIDDEN. It is an anti-pattern that will likely result in full rejection of your contributions. Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`) to write to files. Use your standard tools (e.g., Read, Edit, etc.) to interact with files throughout your session. You will be reminded of this as **Rule 4.4** in the Agent Rules.\n\n## Task-Master Assignment (Conditional)\n\n**IF `$1` is `--custom`:**\n- Run the `/wsd:onboard` command and return to this command\n- Skip the rest of this section and continue to \"## Completion Behavior\"\n- You will receive your workscope directly from the User after this command completes\n\n**OTHERWISE (including if `$1` is empty):**\n- Consult @agent-task-master to fetch your workscope assignment\n- Provide the Task-Master with your Workscope ID that you generated earlier\n- Workscope directive (forward to Task-Master if provided): $1\n\nThe Task-Master has complete instructions in its definition and will:\n  - Create a workscope file at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`\n  - Mark the selected tasks with `[*]` in the relevant checkboxlists\n  - Return the workscope file path to you\n\nRead the workscope file. **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Your workscope will assign SPECIFIC TASK NUMBERS (e.g., \"3.5, 3.6, 3.7\") for execution. While you should understand the entire phase as context for how your tasks fit into the larger picture, you are responsible for EXECUTING only your assigned task numbers.\n\nMANDATORY: After reading your workscope file, literally copy the ENTIRE, VERBATIM content of the workscope document into the Work Journal. Do this before moving on to the next step. The User will read your Work Journal, and if the User does not see the exact, verbatim text of your workscope file present in the Work Journal after it was assigned to you by the Task-Master agent, your entire session will be immediately terminated.\n\n### Phase Inventory Validation\n\nBefore accepting, check the Phase Inventory for this error: \"CLEAR (all [%])\" or any \"CLEAR\" with a qualifier. Phases with `[%]` items are NOT CLEAR.\n\nIf you detect this error: Reject the workscope. Tell Task-Master to delete the invalid workscope file and redo the assignment correctly. This is the one exception to workscope immutability—an invalid workscope must be replaced.\n\n## Completion Behavior\n\nUpon completing the initialization steps above, return to the User with a clear message at the END of your reply.\n\nMANDATORY: Put the following text at the END of your reply, verbatim:\n**\"WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: propose changes, describe the workscope, or `/wsd:prepare`. To abandon completely, `/wsd:abort`.\"**\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe command should handle these error conditions:\n\n1. **Agent communication failures**: Retry agent communications if they fail\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --custom"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"3f62dc7c-f74b-45ed-b6ae-5f68b2db7faa","timestamp":"2026-01-15T23:46:50.290Z"}

The repository serves as both documentation of the issue and a practical tool for other users to verify its occurrence on their own systems.\n     6→\n     7→The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude Code to believe it has successfully read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests through two distinct mechanisms depending on Claude Code version: in older versions (2.0.59 and earlier), read results are cleared from context with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages; in newer versions (2.0.60 and later), large read results return `<persisted-output>` markers that the agent fails to follow up on. In both cases, Claude proceeds as if it received the actual content, operating on incomplete or non-existent information without awareness of the gap.\n     8→\n     9→## Product Vision\n    10→\n    11→### Core Problem\n    12→\n    13→Claude Code exhibits a bug where file read operations fail silently, leaving the AI assistant believing it has read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests differently across versions:\n    14→\n    15→- **Era 1 (versions 2.0.59 and earlier)**: Read results are cleared from context, replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages. The agent proceeds without the content.\n    16→- **Era 2 (versions 2.0.60 and later)**: Large read results are persisted to disk, returning `<persisted-output>` markers. The agent fails to issue follow-up reads to retrieve the persisted content.\n    17→\n    18→In both cases, Claude proceeds with its task, potentially confabulating information about files it never actually read. No \"safe\" version has been identified—all tested versions from 2.0.54 through 2.1.6 have exhibited phantom read behavior under certain conditions.\n    19→\n    20→This bug is particularly insidious because:\n    21→\n    22→1. **Silent Failure**: Claude exhibits no awareness that it missed file content, continuing confidently with incomplete information.\n    23→\n    24→2. **Intermittent Occurrence**: The bug does not manifest consistently, making it difficult to identify as a systematic issue rather than occasional model error.\n    25→\n    26→3. **Masked by Capability**: Claude's strong reasoning abilities allow it to \"gap fill\" plausibly from contextual clues, producing outputs that appear reasonable but are based on assumptions rather than actual file content.\n    27→\n    28→4. **Compounding Context**: Over multi-turn conversations, successful reads in later turns can mask earlier phantom reads, as Claude incorporates corrected information without recognizing the initial failure.\n    29→\n    30→### Solution\n    31→\n    32→This repository provides:\n    33→\n    34→1. **Documentation**: A comprehensive README explaining the Phantom Reads phenomenon, its symptoms, and its suspected cause.\n    35→\n    36→2. **Reproduction Environment**: A structured project with inter-related documents that triggers multi-file read operations, creating conditions where phantom reads are likely to manifest.\n    37→\n    38→3. **Analysis Tools**: Python scripts that examine Claude Code session logs to programmatically detect phantom read occurrences, removing reliance on the AI's self-reporting.\n    39→\n    40→## Terms and Definitions\n    41→\n    42→In addition to the Terms and Definitions you learned as part of the Workscope-Dev system, this specific project has a few more:\n    43→\n    44→- \"Session Agent\": The agent that was working in an example session that experienced and reported a phantom read (or didn't in the case of a success example). This is distinct from a \"User Agent\" (which is _you_) and a Special Agent that you would work with during a workscope lifecycle.\n    45→- \"Phantom Read\": A phenomenon that occurs in the AI harness where a Read operation conducted by the Session Agent does not result in the contents of the file being correctly inserted into the Session Agent's context.\n    46→- \"Inline Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file directly.\n    47→- \"Deferred Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file through some intermediary step, such as a reference to a persisted output or a text file created by a tool internal to the AI harness. Not all deferred reads are presumed to be phantom reads (i.e., it may be the case that the agent correctly followed up on the read after the intermediary message), but we suspect that deferred reads are the cause of phantom reads.\n    48→- \"Era 1\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds up to `2.0.59`, after which a key change occurred in how deferred reads were conducted by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.0.58-good` (success) and `2.0.58-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n    49→- \"Era 2\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds `2.0.60` and later, where deferred reads are handled differently by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.1.6-good` (success) and `2.1.6-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n    50→- \"Flat Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file and the breakout agent session files are stored adjacent in a directory, with only their session IDs to link them. This is an older architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n    51→- \"Hierarchical Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name, which stores all of the breakout agent session files associated with that core session as well as any tool outputs. This is the newer (current) architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n    52→\n    53→## Key Features\n    54→\n    55→### 1. Public README\n    56→\n    57→A user-facing README.md that:\n    58→- Links to the official GitHub issue (#17407)\n    59→- Explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon in accessible terms\n    60→- Documents the experiment methodology and findings\n    61→- Provides step-by-step reproduction instructions\n    62→- Includes guidance on installing specific Claude Code versions for testing\n    63→\n    64→### 2. Reproduction Experiment\n    65→\n    66→A structured environment designed to trigger phantom reads:\n    67→- Inter-related documentation files that prompt multi-file read operations\n    68→- A Work Plan Document (ticket) that serves as the target for the `/refine-plan` command\n    69→- The `/refine-plan` custom command, which triggers deep investigation across specifications and documentation\n    70→\n    71→The experiment leverages the Workscope-Dev (WSD) framework already present in this repository. The `/refine-plan` command naturally triggers reads across multiple files in `docs/read-only/standards/`, `docs/core/`, and related locations—the exact pattern observed to trigger phantom reads in the original investigation.\n    72→\n    73→### 3. Session Analysis Tools\n    74→\n    75→Python scripts in `scripts/` that:\n    76→- Parse Claude Code session `.jsonl` files\n    77→- Identify Read tool invocations that returned phantom read indicators:\n    78→  - Era 2: `<persisted-output>` responses without follow-up reads\n    79→  - Era 1: `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages\n    80→- Report phantom read occurrences with file paths and conversation context\n    81→\n    82→These tools provide objective, programmatic detection that does not rely on the AI's self-assessment of whether it experienced phantom reads.\n    83→\n    84→## Technical Background\n    85→\n    86→### How Claude Code Handles Large Outputs\n    87→\n    88→When a tool result exceeds a size threshold, Claude Code persists the output to disk and returns a marker in this format:\n    89→\n    90→```\n    91→<persisted-output>Tool result saved to: /path/to/file.txt\n    92→\n    93→Use Read to view</persisted-output>\n    94→```\n    95→\n    96→The AI is expected to recognize this marker and issue a follow-up Read command to retrieve the actual content. The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude to treat this marker as if it were the actual content, proceeding without the follow-up read.\n    97→\n    98→### Version History\n    99→\n   100→Testing across Claude Code versions revealed two distinct eras of phantom read behavior:\n   101→\n   102→| Era | Versions        | Error Mechanism                     | Notes                      |\n   103→| --- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n   104→| 1   | 2.0.54 - 2.0.59 | `[Old tool result content cleared]` | Context clearing mechanism |\n   105→| 2   | 2.0.60 - 2.1.6+ | `<persisted-output>`                | Disk persistence mechanism |\n   106→\n   107→**Important**: The original investigation incorrectly concluded that versions 2.0.58 and earlier were unaffected. Subsequent testing confirmed that ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads—the mechanism simply differs between eras.\n   108→\n   109→The transition from Era 1 to Era 2 occurs at the 2.0.59/2.0.60 boundary, suggesting a change in how Claude Code handles large tool results around that release.\n   110→\n   111→### Trigger Conditions\n   112→\n   113→Based on the original investigation, phantom reads appear more likely to occur when:\n   114→\n   115→1. **Multi-file operations**: Commands that trigger reads across multiple files in a single conversation turn\n   116→2. **Custom commands**: Execution context initiated via slash commands (e.g., `/refine-plan`)\n   117→3. **Large file sets**: Operations involving numerous related documents\n   118→\n   119→The exact conditions that determine whether a specific read becomes a phantom read remain under investigation.\n   120→\n   121→## Experiment Methodology\n   122→\n   123→The original investigation followed a systematic protocol to test multiple Claude Code versions and identify version boundaries.

The repository serves as both documentation of the issue and a practical tool for other users to verify its occurrence on their own systems.\n\nThe Phantom Reads bug causes Claude Code to believe it has successfully read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests through two distinct mechanisms depending on Claude Code version: in older versions (2.0.59 and earlier), read results are cleared from context with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages; in newer versions (2.0.60 and later), large read results return `<persisted-output>` markers that the agent fails to follow up on. In both cases, Claude proceeds as if it received the actual content, operating on incomplete or non-existent information without awareness of the gap.\n\n## Product Vision\n\n### Core Problem\n\nClaude Code exhibits a bug where file read operations fail silently, leaving the AI assistant believing it has read file contents when it has not. The bug manifests differently across versions:\n\n- **Era 1 (versions 2.0.59 and earlier)**: Read results are cleared from context, replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages. The agent proceeds without the content.\n- **Era 2 (versions 2.0.60 and later)**: Large read results are persisted to disk, returning `<persisted-output>` markers. The agent fails to issue follow-up reads to retrieve the persisted content.\n\nIn both cases, Claude proceeds with its task, potentially confabulating information about files it never actually read. No \"safe\" version has been identified—all tested versions from 2.0.54 through 2.1.6 have exhibited phantom read behavior under certain conditions.\n\nThis bug is particularly insidious because:\n\n1. **Silent Failure**: Claude exhibits no awareness that it missed file content, continuing confidently with incomplete information.\n\n2. **Intermittent Occurrence**: The bug does not manifest consistently, making it difficult to identify as a systematic issue rather than occasional model error.\n\n3. **Masked by Capability**: Claude's strong reasoning abilities allow it to \"gap fill\" plausibly from contextual clues, producing outputs that appear reasonable but are based on assumptions rather than actual file content.\n\n4. **Compounding Context**: Over multi-turn conversations, successful reads in later turns can mask earlier phantom reads, as Claude incorporates corrected information without recognizing the initial failure.\n\n### Solution\n\nThis repository provides:\n\n1. **Documentation**: A comprehensive README explaining the Phantom Reads phenomenon, its symptoms, and its suspected cause.\n\n2. **Reproduction Environment**: A structured project with inter-related documents that triggers multi-file read operations, creating conditions where phantom reads are likely to manifest.\n\n3. **Analysis Tools**: Python scripts that examine Claude Code session logs to programmatically detect phantom read occurrences, removing reliance on the AI's self-reporting.\n\n## Terms and Definitions\n\nIn addition to the Terms and Definitions you learned as part of the Workscope-Dev system, this specific project has a few more:\n\n- \"Session Agent\": The agent that was working in an example session that experienced and reported a phantom read (or didn't in the case of a success example). This is distinct from a \"User Agent\" (which is _you_) and a Special Agent that you would work with during a workscope lifecycle.\n- \"Phantom Read\": A phenomenon that occurs in the AI harness where a Read operation conducted by the Session Agent does not result in the contents of the file being correctly inserted into the Session Agent's context.\n- \"Inline Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file directly.\n- \"Deferred Read\": When the Session Agent received the contents of a file through some intermediary step, such as a reference to a persisted output or a text file created by a tool internal to the AI harness. Not all deferred reads are presumed to be phantom reads (i.e., it may be the case that the agent correctly followed up on the read after the intermediary message), but we suspect that deferred reads are the cause of phantom reads.\n- \"Era 1\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds up to `2.0.59`, after which a key change occurred in how deferred reads were conducted by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.0.58-good` (success) and `2.0.58-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n- \"Era 2\": (mentioned above) Refers to sessions that took place in builds `2.0.60` and later, where deferred reads are handled differently by the Claude Code harness. For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.1.6-good` (success) and `2.1.6-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n- \"Flat Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file and the breakout agent session files are stored adjacent in a directory, with only their session IDs to link them. This is an older architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n- \"Hierarchical Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name, which stores all of the breakout agent session files associated with that core session as well as any tool outputs. This is the newer (current) architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Public README\n\nA user-facing README.md that:\n- Links to the official GitHub issue (#17407)\n- Explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon in accessible terms\n- Documents the experiment methodology and findings\n- Provides step-by-step reproduction instructions\n- Includes guidance on installing specific Claude Code versions for testing\n\n### 2. Reproduction Experiment\n\nA structured environment designed to trigger phantom reads:\n- Inter-related documentation files that prompt multi-file read operations\n- A Work Plan Document (ticket) that serves as the target for the `/refine-plan` command\n- The `/refine-plan` custom command, which triggers deep investigation across specifications and documentation\n\nThe experiment leverages the Workscope-Dev (WSD) framework already present in this repository. The `/refine-plan` command naturally triggers reads across multiple files in `docs/read-only/standards/`, `docs/core/`, and related locations—the exact pattern observed to trigger phantom reads in the original investigation.\n\n### 3. Session Analysis Tools\n\nPython scripts in `scripts/` that:\n- Parse Claude Code session `.jsonl` files\n- Identify Read tool invocations that returned phantom read indicators:\n  - Era 2: `<persisted-output>` responses without follow-up reads\n  - Era 1: `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages\n- Report phantom read occurrences with file paths and conversation context\n\nThese tools provide objective, programmatic detection that does not rely on the AI's self-assessment of whether it experienced phantom reads.\n\n## Technical Background\n\n### How Claude Code Handles Large Outputs\n\nWhen a tool result exceeds a size threshold, Claude Code persists the output to disk and returns a marker in this format:\n\n```\n<persisted-output>Tool result saved to: /path/to/file.txt\n\nUse Read to view</persisted-output>\n```\n\nThe AI is expected to recognize this marker and issue a follow-up Read command to retrieve the actual content. The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude to treat this marker as if it were the actual content, proceeding without the follow-up read.\n\n### Version History\n\nTesting across Claude Code versions revealed two distinct eras of phantom read behavior:\n\n| Era | Versions        | Error Mechanism                     | Notes                      |\n| --- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| 1   | 2.0.54 - 2.0.59 | `[Old tool result content cleared]` | Context clearing mechanism |\n| 2   | 2.0.60 - 2.1.6+ | `<persisted-output>`                | Disk persistence mechanism |\n\n**Important**: The original investigation incorrectly concluded that versions 2.0.58 and earlier were unaffected. Subsequent testing confirmed that ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads—the mechanism simply differs between eras.\n\nThe transition from Era 1 to Era 2 occurs at the 2.0.59/2.0.60 boundary, suggesting a change in how Claude Code handles large tool results around that release.\n\n### Trigger Conditions\n\nBased on the original investigation, phantom reads appear more likely to occur when:\n\n1. **Multi-file operations**: Commands that trigger reads across multiple files in a single conversation turn\n2. **Custom commands**: Execution context initiated via slash commands (e.g., `/refine-plan`)\n3. **Large file sets**: Operations involving numerous related documents\n\nThe exact conditions that determine whether a specific read becomes a phantom read remain under investigation.\n\n## Experiment Methodology\n\nThe original investigation followed a systematic protocol to test multiple Claude Code versions and identify version boundaries. The full methodology from the original investigation is preserved in:\n\n**[Experiment-Methodology-01.md](Experiment-Methodology-01.md)** (historical document with addendum)\n\n### Summary\n\nThe investigation used a self-report methodology: trigger multi-file read operations via `/wsd:init --custom` followed by `/refine-plan`, then prompt the agent to report whether any phantom reads occurred.\n\n**Original findings** (later revised):\n- Pre-2.0.59 versions appeared unaffected\n- Post-2.0.59 versions showed consistent failures\n\n**Revised understanding**:\n- ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads\n- Era 1 (2.0.59 and earlier): `[Old tool result content cleared]` mechanism\n- Era 2 (2.0.60 and later): `<persisted-output>` mechanism\n- The original investigation likely conflated the two mechanisms\n\nFor ongoing investigation notes, see `Investigation-Journal.md`.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe self-report methodology has inherent limitations (model incentives, introspection accuracy, non-determinism). Additionally, the original investigation failed to distinguish between the two phantom read mechanisms, leading to incorrect conclusions about \"safe\" versions. The analysis tools in this repository address these limitations by examining session logs programmatically, removing the model from the detection loop.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n```\n├── README.md                        # User-facing documentation\n├── docs/\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── PRD.md                  # This document (internal)\n│   │   ├── Action-Plan.md          # Implementation checkboxlist\n│   │   ├── Design-Decisions.md     # Project design rationale\n│   │   ├── Investigation-Journal.md # Running log of discoveries\n│   │   └── Experiment-Methodology-01.md # Original methodology (historical)\n│   ├── read-only/                  # WSD standards (read triggers)\n│   ├── tickets/\n│   │   └── open/                   # WPD targets for /refine-plan\n│   └── workbench/                  # Working documents\n├── dev/\n│   └── misc/                       # Session samples (good/bad cases by version)\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── archive_claude_sessions.py  # Session archival utility\n│   └── analyze_phantom_reads.py    # Phantom read detector (to build)\n└── .claude/\n    └── commands/\n        └── refine-plan.md          # Trigger command\n```\n\n### Key Components\n\n**Trigger Mechanism**: The `/refine-plan` command executed against a ticket in `docs/tickets/open/`.

I have thoroughly reviewed your status and identified the critical compliance requirements for your workscope.\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: MANDATORY READING - COMPLETE THESE NOW\n\nYou stated that you have already read the core WSD system documents. However, **DO NOT ASSUME** you can skip reading them again. You MUST verify you understand these files:\n\n### ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - READ EVERY WORD\n\n1. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`**\n   - **132 numbered rules** that govern ALL agent behavior\n   - **VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE REJECTION** of your entire workscope\n   - Re-read it NOW even if you think you know it\n\n2. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`**\n   - Applies to ANY code you write\n   - Required for all code contributions\n\n3. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`**\n   - This is a Python project - these rules are MANDATORY\n   - Type hints, docstrings, tooling requirements\n\n4. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`**\n   - If you write ANY tests, these standards are NON-NEGOTIABLE\n   - 13 standards covering environment isolation, file system isolation, network mocking\n\n5. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`**\n   - If you change code, you MUST update specifications\n   - Failure to update specs = Rule 3.5 violation = REJECTION\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2: THE THREE MOST VIOLATED RULES\n\nBased on historical patterns, these are the rules User Agents violate most frequently:\n\n### ❌ RULE 5.1 - THE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY KILLER\n\n**THIS APP HAS NOT SHIPPED YET. DO NOT SUPPORT BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.**\n\n```\nWhen we make a change, please do not include migration-based solutions \nor be concerned with maintaining \"backward compatibility\" or \"legacy support.\" \nDO NOT BE CONCERNED WITH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.\n```\n\n**Common violations:**\n- Adding \"migration notes\" in code comments\n- Creating \"verify_refactor\" tests\n- Including comments like \"Note: Must use X since Y now uses Z\"\n- ANY reference to \"old design\" vs \"new design\"\n\n**If you violate this rule:** The Rules-Enforcer will REJECT YOUR ENTIRE WORKSCOPE immediately.\n\n### ❌ RULE 3.4 - META-PROCESS REFERENCES\n\n**Do NOT include meta-process references in product artifacts.**\n\n**Product artifacts** (Rule 3.4 APPLIES):\n- Source code files\n- Test files  \n- Scripts\n- Configuration files\n- Anything that ships\n\n**Process documents** (Rule 3.4 does NOT apply):\n- Feature specs\n- Tickets\n- Action Plans\n- Workbench docs\n\n**Violations in product artifacts:**\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: \"Extracted from cli.py during Phase 2 refactoring\"\n# ❌ BAD: \"Logs warnings for malformed tags (task 2.5.4)\"\n# ❌ BAD: \"Fixed null pointer (see ticket #47)\"\n```\n\n**This rule is so frequently violated that we created a special audit tool to catch it.**\n\n### ❌ RULE 3.11 - WRITE ACCESS BLOCKED\n\n**If you need to edit a file in a read-only directory, copy it to `docs/workbench/`.**\n\nWhen you get a write access error:\n1. Copy the file to `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/workbench/` with the EXACT same filename\n2. Edit the workbench copy directly (no annotations, no meta-information)\n3. Inform the User\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- Try to force write access\n- Ask the User what to do (the rule tells you exactly what to do)\n- Give up on the edit\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 3: PYTHON PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS\n\n### Code Quality Standards\n\nFrom **Python-Standards.md**:\n- ✅ Use `uv` for dependency management (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest`)\n- ✅ ALL functions need explicit return type annotations (even `-> None`)\n- ✅ Type parameters MUST be lowercase (`list[int]` NOT `List[int]`)\n- ✅ Use Google-style docstrings with `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`\n- ✅ Prefer `Path.open()` over `open()`\n- ✅ Use f-strings for formatting\n- ✅ Shebangs: `#!/usr/bin/env python` (NOT `python3`)\n\n### Testing Standards\n\nFrom **Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md**:\n- ✅ **EVERY test must use `@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)`** for default behavior\n- ✅ **EVERY test must use `tmp_path`** for file operations\n- ✅ **EVERY test must mock network calls** (unless marked as integration test)\n- ✅ Test docstrings must document ALL parameters including pytest fixtures\n- ✅ When patching module constants like `PROJECT_ROOT`, patch ALL derived constants too\n\n### Specification Maintenance\n\nFrom **Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md**:\n- ✅ If you change code, you MUST update specifications in the SAME workscope\n- ✅ Configuration changes → update Config-Spec.md\n- ✅ Environment variables → update Environment-Variables-Spec.md\n- ✅ CLI changes → update CLI-Commands-Spec.md\n\n**Failing to update specs = Agent Rule 3.5 violation = REJECTION**\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 4: PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT\n\n### What This Project Is\n\nFrom **PRD.md**, this is a reproduction environment for Claude Code Issue #17407 (\"Phantom Reads\"):\n- **Purpose**: Demonstrate a bug where Claude believes it read files when it didn't\n- **Two Eras**: Era 1 (≤2.0.59) uses `[Old tool result content cleared]`, Era 2 (≥2.0.60) uses `<persisted-output>`\n- **Methodology**: The `/refine-plan` command triggers multi-file reads that expose the bug\n\n### Key Terminology (from PRD.md)\n\n- **Session Agent**: Agent in example sessions that experienced phantom reads (NOT you)\n- **Phantom Read**: Read operation that doesn't insert file contents into context\n- **Inline Read**: Contents received directly\n- **Deferred Read**: Contents via intermediary (suspected cause of phantom reads)\n- **Era 1/Era 2**: Different phantom read mechanisms across Claude Code versions\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n```\ndocs/core/                    # PRD, Action-Plan, Design-Decisions (source of truth)\ndocs/read-only/              # Standards and rules (DO NOT EDIT - use Rule 3.11)\ndocs/tickets/open/           # Tickets for /refine-plan trigger\ndev/misc/                    # Example sessions (good/bad cases)\nscripts/                     # Analysis tools\n.claude/commands/            # Custom commands including /refine-plan\n```\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 5: CODING STANDARDS CHECKLIST\n\nWhen writing ANY code:\n\n### General (Coding-Standards.md)\n- [ ] Fail immediately at point of failure (no workarounds for internal logic errors)\n- [ ] Follow Chesterton's Fence (understand why before removing)\n- [ ] Handle external uncertainties gracefully, be strict about internal logic\n- [ ] Favor Sources of Truth (don't duplicate state)\n- [ ] Conflict priority: Documentation > Test > Code\n- [ ] Use comment blocks for all files, classes, functions\n- [ ] Check comment blocks after edits\n- [ ] Use 4 spaces for indentation\n- [ ] No meta-process references in code\n\n### Python-Specific (Python-Standards.md)\n- [ ] Explicit return type annotations on ALL functions\n- [ ] Lowercase type parameters (`list[int]`)\n- [ ] Google-style docstrings\n- [ ] Document all public functions and classes\n- [ ] Use `uv` for commands (`uv run pytest`, etc.)\n\n### Testing (Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md)\n- [ ] `@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)` for default behavior tests\n- [ ] `@patch.dict(os.environ, {...})` for environment-dependent tests\n- [ ] Use `tmp_path` for ALL file operations\n- [ ] Mock ALL network calls in unit tests\n- [ ] Document ALL test parameters (including pytest fixtures)\n- [ ] Patch ALL derived constants when patching base constants\n- [ ] Never read from actual user directories\n- [ ] Never assume cache state\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 6: COMMON PITFALLS - AVOID THESE\n\n### Don't Do This\n\n1. **❌ Write code without updating specs** (Rule 3.5 violation)\n2. **❌ Add \"backward compatibility\" or \"migration notes\"** (Rule 5.1 violation)\n3. **❌ Reference task numbers, phases, or tickets in code** (Rule 3.4 violation)\n4. **❌ Use `cat >>`, `echo >>`, or `<< EOF` to write files** (Rule 4.4 violation)\n5. **❌ Edit files in `docs/read-only/`** (Rule 2.1.2 violation - use Rule 3.11 instead)\n6. **❌ Run git commands that modify state** (Rule 2.2 violation)\n7. **❌ Create temp files in project root** (Rule 4.1 violation - use `dev/diagnostics/`)\n8. **❌ Write tests without `@patch.dict` or `tmp_path`** (Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards)\n9. **❌ Use `List[int]` instead of `list[int]`** (Python-Standards violation)\n10. **❌ Skip docstrings or type hints** (Python-Standards violation)\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 7: NEEDS-VALIDATION TASKS (`[%]`)\n\nIf your workscope includes `[%]` tasks:\n\n**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**\n- **Treat `[%]` EXACTLY like `[ ]`** - you are fully responsible for complete implementation\n- Some/all work may exist, but **DO NOT ASSUME IT'S CORRECT**\n- The `[%]` is a WARNING: \"Don't get lazy - verify everything\"\n- Your job: Find the delta between current implementation and spec, then implement it\n- **Common failure**: Seeing existing code, assuming it's done, skipping verification\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read the spec for what SHOULD exist\n2. Read the code for what DOES exist\n3. Identify the gaps (the delta)\n4. Implement the delta\n5. Verify complete alignment with spec\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 8: FINAL CHECKPOINT BEFORE PROCEEDING\n\n### Before You Begin Your Workscope\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. ✅ Confirm you have read (or re-read) ALL files listed in Phase 1\n2. ✅ Confirm you understand the three most violated rules (Phase 2)\n3. ✅ Confirm you understand this is a Python project with specific standards\n4. ✅ Confirm you understand this is a Phantom Reads investigation project\n5. ✅ **HALT and check in with the User before continuing**\n\n### After Speaking With Me\n\n**Per Agent-Rules.md guidance for Project-Bootstrapper:**\n> After speaking with you, User Agents are expected to halt and check in with the user before continuing.\n\n**YOU MUST NOW:**\n- **STOP**\n- **Report to the User** that onboarding is complete\n- **Wait for the User** to provide your custom workscope\n- **DO NOT PROCEED** with any work until the User gives you the workscope assignment\n\n---\n\n## YOUR NEXT ACTION\n\n**Respond to the User with:**\n1. Confirmation that you have reviewed all mandatory documents\n2. Acknowledgment of the three most-violated rules and your commitment to avoid them\n3. Any questions about project-specific requirements BEFORE receiving your workscope\n4. **Request for your custom workscope assignment**\n\n**Remember**: You are in a `--custom` initialization.

I have thoroughly reviewed your status and identified the critical compliance requirements for your workscope.\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: MANDATORY READING - COMPLETE THESE NOW\n\nYou stated that you have already read the core WSD system documents. However, **DO NOT ASSUME** you can skip reading them again. You MUST verify you understand these files:\n\n### ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - READ EVERY WORD\n\n1. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`**\n   - **132 numbered rules** that govern ALL agent behavior\n   - **VIOLATION = IMMEDIATE REJECTION** of your entire workscope\n   - Re-read it NOW even if you think you know it\n\n2. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`**\n   - Applies to ANY code you write\n   - Required for all code contributions\n\n3. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`**\n   - This is a Python project - these rules are MANDATORY\n   - Type hints, docstrings, tooling requirements\n\n4. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`**\n   - If you write ANY tests, these standards are NON-NEGOTIABLE\n   - 13 standards covering environment isolation, file system isolation, network mocking\n\n5. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`**\n   - If you change code, you MUST update specifications\n   - Failure to update specs = Rule 3.5 violation = REJECTION\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2: THE THREE MOST VIOLATED RULES\n\nBased on historical patterns, these are the rules User Agents violate most frequently:\n\n### ❌ RULE 5.1 - THE BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY KILLER\n\n**THIS APP HAS NOT SHIPPED YET. DO NOT SUPPORT BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.**\n\n```\nWhen we make a change, please do not include migration-based solutions \nor be concerned with maintaining \"backward compatibility\" or \"legacy support.\" \nDO NOT BE CONCERNED WITH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.\n```\n\n**Common violations:**\n- Adding \"migration notes\" in code comments\n- Creating \"verify_refactor\" tests\n- Including comments like \"Note: Must use X since Y now uses Z\"\n- ANY reference to \"old design\" vs \"new design\"\n\n**If you violate this rule:** The Rules-Enforcer will REJECT YOUR ENTIRE WORKSCOPE immediately.\n\n### ❌ RULE 3.4 - META-PROCESS REFERENCES\n\n**Do NOT include meta-process references in product artifacts.**\n\n**Product artifacts** (Rule 3.4 APPLIES):\n- Source code files\n- Test files  \n- Scripts\n- Configuration files\n- Anything that ships\n\n**Process documents** (Rule 3.4 does NOT apply):\n- Feature specs\n- Tickets\n- Action Plans\n- Workbench docs\n\n**Violations in product artifacts:**\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: \"Extracted from cli.py during Phase 2 refactoring\"\n# ❌ BAD: \"Logs warnings for malformed tags (task 2.5.4)\"\n# ❌ BAD: \"Fixed null pointer (see ticket #47)\"\n```\n\n**This rule is so frequently violated that we created a special audit tool to catch it.**\n\n### ❌ RULE 3.11 - WRITE ACCESS BLOCKED\n\n**If you need to edit a file in a read-only directory, copy it to `docs/workbench/`.**\n\nWhen you get a write access error:\n1. Copy the file to `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/workbench/` with the EXACT same filename\n2. Edit the workbench copy directly (no annotations, no meta-information)\n3. Inform the User\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- Try to force write access\n- Ask the User what to do (the rule tells you exactly what to do)\n- Give up on the edit\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 3: PYTHON PROJECT-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS\n\n### Code Quality Standards\n\nFrom **Python-Standards.md**:\n- ✅ Use `uv` for dependency management (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest`)\n- ✅ ALL functions need explicit return type annotations (even `-> None`)\n- ✅ Type parameters MUST be lowercase (`list[int]` NOT `List[int]`)\n- ✅ Use Google-style docstrings with `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`\n- ✅ Prefer `Path.open()` over `open()`\n- ✅ Use f-strings for formatting\n- ✅ Shebangs: `#!/usr/bin/env python` (NOT `python3`)\n\n### Testing Standards\n\nFrom **Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md**:\n- ✅ **EVERY test must use `@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)`** for default behavior\n- ✅ **EVERY test must use `tmp_path`** for file operations\n- ✅ **EVERY test must mock network calls** (unless marked as integration test)\n- ✅ Test docstrings must document ALL parameters including pytest fixtures\n- ✅ When patching module constants like `PROJECT_ROOT`, patch ALL derived constants too\n\n### Specification Maintenance\n\nFrom **Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md**:\n- ✅ If you change code, you MUST update specifications in the SAME workscope\n- ✅ Configuration changes → update Config-Spec.md\n- ✅ Environment variables → update Environment-Variables-Spec.md\n- ✅ CLI changes → update CLI-Commands-Spec.md\n\n**Failing to update specs = Agent Rule 3.5 violation = REJECTION**\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 4: PROJECT-SPECIFIC CONTEXT\n\n### What This Project Is\n\nFrom **PRD.md**, this is a reproduction environment for Claude Code Issue #17407 (\"Phantom Reads\"):\n- **Purpose**: Demonstrate a bug where Claude believes it read files when it didn't\n- **Two Eras**: Era 1 (≤2.0.59) uses `[Old tool result content cleared]`, Era 2 (≥2.0.60) uses `<persisted-output>`\n- **Methodology**: The `/refine-plan` command triggers multi-file reads that expose the bug\n\n### Key Terminology (from PRD.md)\n\n- **Session Agent**: Agent in example sessions that experienced phantom reads (NOT you)\n- **Phantom Read**: Read operation that doesn't insert file contents into context\n- **Inline Read**: Contents received directly\n- **Deferred Read**: Contents via intermediary (suspected cause of phantom reads)\n- **Era 1/Era 2**: Different phantom read mechanisms across Claude Code versions\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n```\ndocs/core/                    # PRD, Action-Plan, Design-Decisions (source of truth)\ndocs/read-only/              # Standards and rules (DO NOT EDIT - use Rule 3.11)\ndocs/tickets/open/           # Tickets for /refine-plan trigger\ndev/misc/                    # Example sessions (good/bad cases)\nscripts/                     # Analysis tools\n.claude/commands/            # Custom commands including /refine-plan\n```\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 5: CODING STANDARDS CHECKLIST\n\nWhen writing ANY code:\n\n### General (Coding-Standards.md)\n- [ ] Fail immediately at point of failure (no workarounds for internal logic errors)\n- [ ] Follow Chesterton's Fence (understand why before removing)\n- [ ] Handle external uncertainties gracefully, be strict about internal logic\n- [ ] Favor Sources of Truth (don't duplicate state)\n- [ ] Conflict priority: Documentation > Test > Code\n- [ ] Use comment blocks for all files, classes, functions\n- [ ] Check comment blocks after edits\n- [ ] Use 4 spaces for indentation\n- [ ] No meta-process references in code\n\n### Python-Specific (Python-Standards.md)\n- [ ] Explicit return type annotations on ALL functions\n- [ ] Lowercase type parameters (`list[int]`)\n- [ ] Google-style docstrings\n- [ ] Document all public functions and classes\n- [ ] Use `uv` for commands (`uv run pytest`, etc.)\n\n### Testing (Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md)\n- [ ] `@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)` for default behavior tests\n- [ ] `@patch.dict(os.environ, {...})` for environment-dependent tests\n- [ ] Use `tmp_path` for ALL file operations\n- [ ] Mock ALL network calls in unit tests\n- [ ] Document ALL test parameters (including pytest fixtures)\n- [ ] Patch ALL derived constants when patching base constants\n- [ ] Never read from actual user directories\n- [ ] Never assume cache state\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 6: COMMON PITFALLS - AVOID THESE\n\n### Don't Do This\n\n1. **❌ Write code without updating specs** (Rule 3.5 violation)\n2. **❌ Add \"backward compatibility\" or \"migration notes\"** (Rule 5.1 violation)\n3. **❌ Reference task numbers, phases, or tickets in code** (Rule 3.4 violation)\n4. **❌ Use `cat >>`, `echo >>`, or `<< EOF` to write files** (Rule 4.4 violation)\n5. **❌ Edit files in `docs/read-only/`** (Rule 2.1.2 violation - use Rule 3.11 instead)\n6. **❌ Run git commands that modify state** (Rule 2.2 violation)\n7. **❌ Create temp files in project root** (Rule 4.1 violation - use `dev/diagnostics/`)\n8. **❌ Write tests without `@patch.dict` or `tmp_path`** (Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards)\n9. **❌ Use `List[int]` instead of `list[int]`** (Python-Standards violation)\n10. **❌ Skip docstrings or type hints** (Python-Standards violation)\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 7: NEEDS-VALIDATION TASKS (`[%]`)\n\nIf your workscope includes `[%]` tasks:\n\n**CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING:**\n- **Treat `[%]` EXACTLY like `[ ]`** - you are fully responsible for complete implementation\n- Some/all work may exist, but **DO NOT ASSUME IT'S CORRECT**\n- The `[%]` is a WARNING: \"Don't get lazy - verify everything\"\n- Your job: Find the delta between current implementation and spec, then implement it\n- **Common failure**: Seeing existing code, assuming it's done, skipping verification\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read the spec for what SHOULD exist\n2. Read the code for what DOES exist\n3. Identify the gaps (the delta)\n4. Implement the delta\n5. Verify complete alignment with spec\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 8: FINAL CHECKPOINT BEFORE PROCEEDING\n\n### Before You Begin Your Workscope\n\n**YOU MUST:**\n1. ✅ Confirm you have read (or re-read) ALL files listed in Phase 1\n2. ✅ Confirm you understand the three most violated rules (Phase 2)\n3. ✅ Confirm you understand this is a Python project with specific standards\n4. ✅ Confirm you understand this is a Phantom Reads investigation project\n5. ✅ **HALT and check in with the User before continuing**\n\n### After Speaking With Me\n\n**Per Agent-Rules.md guidance for Project-Bootstrapper:**\n> After speaking with you, User Agents are expected to halt and check in with the user before continuing.\n\n**YOU MUST NOW:**\n- **STOP**\n- **Report to the User** that onboarding is complete\n- **Wait for the User** to provide your custom workscope\n- **DO NOT PROCEED** with any work until the User gives you the workscope assignment\n\n---\n\n## YOUR NEXT ACTION\n\n**Respond to the User with:**\n1. Confirmation that you have reviewed all mandatory documents\n2. Acknowledgment of the three most-violated rules and your commitment to avoid them\n3. Any questions about project-specific requirements BEFORE receiving your workscope\n4. **Request for your custom workscope assignment**\n\n**Remember**: You are in a `--custom` initialization. The User will provide your workscope directly. Do not proceed until you receive it.\n\n---\n\n## ABSOLUTE FILE PATHS FOR REFERENCE\n\nAll file paths mentioned above (absolute paths as required):\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/PRD.md`\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`\n\nGood luck with your workscope.

For example, instead of ` with open(model_file) as f:`, use `with model_file.open() as f:`.\n- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines\n- Keep functions focused and small\n- **Document all public functions and classes** - use Google-style docstrings with `Args:`, `Returns:`, and `Raises:` sections where applicable\n- **Dataclasses require complete field documentation** - see `Data-Structure-Documentation-Standards.md`\n- **Test methods must document ALL parameters** (including pytest fixtures like `tmp_path`, `monkeypatch`, `capsys`) in Args sections with consistent descriptions:\n  - `tmp_path: Pytest fixture providing temporary directory for test files`\n  - `monkeypatch: Pytest fixture for modifying environment and attributes`\n  - `capsys: Pytest fixture for capturing stdout/stderr output`\n  - `caplog: Pytest fixture for capturing log messages`\n  - Custom fixtures and mocks should describe their specific purpose\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Use meaningful variable and function names\n- Handle errors gracefully with proper logging\n- Use f-strings for string formatting\n- Create shebangs as the modern `#!/usr/bin/env python`, NOT the historical `#!/usr/bin/env python3`\n","numLines":35,"startLine":1,"totalLines":35}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"fb7b56ce-5d66-46f0-878d-441c4ae0bedb"}

Apply the same synchronization principles.\n   142→\n   143→## Specification Update Process\n   144→\n   145→### 1. Identify Affected Specifications\n   146→\n   147→Before implementing code changes, determine which specifications will require updates. Ask:\n   148→\n   149→- Am I modifying configuration schema or defaults? → Configuration specification\n   150→- Am I adding environment variable reads? → Environment variable specification\n   151→- Am I adding or changing CLI flags? → CLI specification\n   152→- Am I adding or modifying API endpoints? → API specification\n   153→\n   154→Multiple specifications may require updates for a single feature. A configuration option often has a corresponding CLI flag and environment variable override—all three specifications need updates.\n   155→\n   156→### 2. Implement Code Changes\n   157→\n   158→Complete the workscope tasks. Track:\n   159→- New configuration options and their defaults\n   160→- New environment variables and their purposes\n   161→- New CLI flags or API endpoints and their behaviors\n   162→- Removed or renamed options\n   163→\n   164→### 3. Update Specifications\n   165→\n   166→For each affected specification:\n   167→\n   168→**Read the specification** to understand its structure and formatting. Match existing patterns.\n   169→\n   170→**Locate the appropriate section** for your change. Configuration options are typically grouped by category. Environment variables by purpose. CLI flags by command.\n   171→\n   172→**Add, modify, or remove documentation** matching your code changes. Use consistent formatting with existing entries.\n   173→\n   174→**Include concrete examples** showing actual usage. Examples should be executable code snippets or command-line invocations that users can copy.\n   175→\n   176→**Update cross-references** if option names changed. Configuration options referenced from environment variable sections need consistency.\n   177→\n   178→\n   179→\n   180→### 4. Verify Synchronization\n   181→\n   182→After updating code and specifications, verify accuracy:\n   183→\n   184→**Manual verification**:\n   185→- Review each documented feature against implementation\n   186→- Test that examples actually work\n   187→- Confirm all new features are documented\n   188→- Verify removed features are removed from specifications\n   189→\n   190→**Automated verification** (if project implements drift detection):\n   191→- Run the project's specification drift audit tool\n   192→- Address any reported missing documentation (code exists, spec doesn't)\n   193→- Address any reported dead documentation (spec exists, code doesn't)\n   194→- Re-run until verification passes\n   195→\n   196→Some projects implement automated drift detection scripts that parse specifications and code to identify discrepancies. These tools report missing documentation and dead documentation systematically. If available, use them. If not, rely on careful manual review.\n   197→\n   198→## Language-Specific Documentation Patterns\n   199→\n   200→### Python Projects\n   201→\n   202→Configuration options typically use snake_case and are often nested dictionaries:\n   203→\n   204→```markdown\n   205→### cache.max_size\n   206→\n   207→**Type**: `int`\n   208→**Default**: `1000`\n   209→\n   210→Maximum entries in cache.

Maintain synchronization as you work rather than batch updates at the end.\n   288→\n   289→### Before Completion\n   290→\n   291→Verify all specifications are synchronized:\n   292→- Check that every code change has corresponding documentation\n   293→- Run drift detection if available\n   294→- Document specification updates in Work Journal\n   295→\n   296→Workscopes involving code changes are incomplete until specifications are updated. Documentation-Steward agents may review specification synchronization during quality assurance.\n   297→\n   298→## Definition of Done\n   299→\n   300→A workscope with code changes is complete only when:\n   301→\n   302→1. Code changes are implemented and tested\n   303→2. All affected specifications are updated\n   304→3. Specifications accurately describe implementation\n   305→4. Drift verification passes (manual or automated)\n   306→5. Work Journal documents specification changes\n   307→\n   308→Attempting to complete a workscope without specification updates violates Agent Rule 3.11 and will result in workscope rejection.\n   309→\n   310→## Common Pitfalls\n   311→\n   312→### Forgetting Specifications Exist\n   313→\n   314→Agents implement features but forget specification documents need updates.\n   315→\n   316→**Solution**: Review specification requirements during workscope planning.

When code changes but specifications don't, \"specification drift\" occurs—documentation misleads developers and users about actual behavior. Agent Rule 3.11 requires specification updates in the same workscope as code changes.\n\n## Specification Drift\n\nDrift manifests in three forms:\n\n**Missing Documentation**: Code implements features not documented in specifications. An agent adds a configuration option but doesn't document it. Users and future developers cannot discover the option exists.\n\n**Dead Documentation**: Specifications describe features not present in code. An agent removes a CLI flag but leaves it documented. Users attempt to use non-existent features.\n\n**Inconsistent Documentation**: Code and specifications both exist but describe different behavior. An agent changes a default value in code but doesn't update the documented default. Users expect incorrect behavior.\n\nAll three forms undermine specification trustworthiness and must be prevented through systematic maintenance.\n\n## When Specifications Require Updates\n\n### Configuration Changes\n\nConfiguration specifications document available configuration options, their types, defaults, and behavior. Update these specifications when:\n\n- Adding a configuration option with its schema and default value\n- Removing a configuration option\n- Changing an option's name, type, or default value\n- Modifying how an option affects application behavior\n- Adding or removing validation rules\n\n**Recognition Patterns:**\n\nIn Python projects, watch for changes to default configuration dictionaries, dataclass definitions, or schema validators:\n```python\n# Changes requiring specification updates\ndef get_default_config():\n    return {\n        \"cache\": {\n            \"max_size\": 1000,  # New option or changed default\n            \"ttl_seconds\": 3600  # New option\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nIn TypeScript projects, watch for changes to configuration interfaces, default objects, or validation schemas:\n```typescript\n// Changes requiring specification updates\ninterface Config {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: number;  // New property or type change\n    ttlSeconds: number;  // New property\n  }\n}\n\nconst defaultConfig: Config = {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: 1000,  // Changed default\n    ttlSeconds: 3600  // New default\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Environment Variable Changes\n\nEnvironment variable specifications document variables affecting application behavior, their purposes, and precedence. Update these specifications when:\n\n- Adding code that reads a new environment variable\n- Removing code that reads an environment variable\n- Changing how an environment variable is interpreted\n- Modifying environment variable precedence or fallback logic\n\n**Recognition Patterns:**\n\nIn Python projects, watch for `os.environ`, `os.getenv`, or environment management utilities:\n```python\n# Changes requiring specification updates\ncache_dir = os.getenv(\"APP_CACHE_DIR\", \"/tmp/cache\")  # New variable\napi_key = os.environ[\"API_KEY\"]  # New required variable\n```\n\nIn TypeScript projects, watch for `process.env` accesses or environment parsers:\n```typescript\n// Changes requiring specification updates\nconst cacheDir = process.env.APP_CACHE_DIR ?? \"/tmp/cache\";  // New variable\nconst apiKey = process.env.API_KEY!;  // New required variable\n```\n\n### Command Interface Changes\n\nCommand interface specifications document CLI commands, flags, options, or API endpoints. Update these specifications when:\n\n- Adding a command-line flag, API endpoint, or interactive command\n- Removing a command-line flag or endpoint\n- Changing a flag's name, aliases, type, or behavior\n- Modifying command behavior or output format\n- Changing API request/response schemas\n\n**Recognition Patterns:**\n\nIn CLI applications (Python with argparse/click/typer, Node with commander/yargs):\n```python\n# Python CLI - changes requiring specification updates\n@click.option(\"--format\", type=click.Choice([\"json\", \"yaml\"]))  # New flag\n@click.option(\"--cache-dir\", help=\"Cache directory\")  # New flag\n```\n\n```typescript\n// TypeScript CLI - changes requiring specification updates\nprogram\n  .option(\"--format <type>\", \"output format\", \"json\")  // New flag\n  .option(\"--cache-dir <path>\", \"cache directory\");  // New flag\n```\n\nIn API applications, watch for new routes, changed endpoints, or modified schemas:\n```python\n# Flask/FastAPI - changes requiring specification updates\n@app.post(\"/api/users\")  # New endpoint\ndef create_user(user: UserCreate):  # New schema\n```\n\n```typescript\n// Express/Fastify - changes requiring specification updates\napp.post(\"/api/users\", handler);  // New endpoint\ninterface UserCreate { ... }  // New schema\n```\n\n## Common Specification Documents\n\nRecognize these specification patterns across projects:\n\n**Configuration Specifications** document config file options. Common files: `Config-Spec.md`, `Configuration.md`, `Settings-Reference.md`. Updated when configuration schemas, defaults, or loading logic changes.\n\n**Environment Variable Specifications** document environment variables affecting behavior. Common files: `Environment-Variables-Spec.md`, `Environment.md`, `Env-Vars.md`. Updated when code reads new environment variables or changes variable interpretation.\n\n**CLI Command Specifications** document command-line interfaces. Common files: `CLI-Commands-Spec.md`, `CLI-Reference.md`, `Command-Line-Interface.md`. Updated when CLI parsers define new flags or modify command behavior.\n\n**API Specifications** document HTTP endpoints. Common files: `API-Spec.md`, `API-Reference.md`, `Endpoints.md`. Updated when routes change or request/response schemas modify.\n\nProjects may maintain additional specifications for database schemas, event formats, plugin interfaces, or data structures. Apply the same synchronization principles.\n\n## Specification Update Process\n\n### 1. Identify Affected Specifications\n\nBefore implementing code changes, determine which specifications will require updates. Ask:\n\n- Am I modifying configuration schema or defaults? → Configuration specification\n- Am I adding environment variable reads? → Environment variable specification\n- Am I adding or changing CLI flags? → CLI specification\n- Am I adding or modifying API endpoints? → API specification\n\nMultiple specifications may require updates for a single feature. A configuration option often has a corresponding CLI flag and environment variable override—all three specifications need updates.\n\n### 2. Implement Code Changes\n\nComplete the workscope tasks. Track:\n- New configuration options and their defaults\n- New environment variables and their purposes\n- New CLI flags or API endpoints and their behaviors\n- Removed or renamed options\n\n### 3. Update Specifications\n\nFor each affected specification:\n\n**Read the specification** to understand its structure and formatting. Match existing patterns.\n\n**Locate the appropriate section** for your change. Configuration options are typically grouped by category. Environment variables by purpose. CLI flags by command.\n\n**Add, modify, or remove documentation** matching your code changes. Use consistent formatting with existing entries.\n\n**Include concrete examples** showing actual usage. Examples should be executable code snippets or command-line invocations that users can copy.\n\n**Update cross-references** if option names changed. Configuration options referenced from environment variable sections need consistency.\n\n\n\n### 4. Verify Synchronization\n\nAfter updating code and specifications, verify accuracy:\n\n**Manual verification**:\n- Review each documented feature against implementation\n- Test that examples actually work\n- Confirm all new features are documented\n- Verify removed features are removed from specifications\n\n**Automated verification** (if project implements drift detection):\n- Run the project's specification drift audit tool\n- Address any reported missing documentation (code exists, spec doesn't)\n- Address any reported dead documentation (spec exists, code doesn't)\n- Re-run until verification passes\n\nSome projects implement automated drift detection scripts that parse specifications and code to identify discrepancies. These tools report missing documentation and dead documentation systematically. If available, use them. If not, rely on careful manual review.\n\n## Language-Specific Documentation Patterns\n\n### Python Projects\n\nConfiguration options typically use snake_case and are often nested dictionaries:\n\n```markdown\n### cache.max_size\n\n**Type**: `int`\n**Default**: `1000`\n\nMaximum entries in cache. Oldest entries evicted when limit reached.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nconfig = {\n    \"cache\": {\n        \"max_size\": 500\n    }\n}\n```\n```\n\nEnvironment variables follow uppercase snake_case conventions:\n```markdown\n### APP_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n\nDirectory for cache files. Must have write permissions.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\nexport APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n```\n```\n\n### TypeScript Projects\n\nConfiguration options typically use camelCase and are interface-typed:\n\n```markdown\n### cache.maxSize\n\n**Type**: `number`\n**Default**: `1000`\n\nMaximum entries in cache. Oldest entries evicted when limit reached.\n\n**Example**:\n```typescript\nconst config = {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: 500\n  }\n};\n```\n```\n\nEnvironment variables follow the same uppercase patterns as Python:\n```markdown\n### APP_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n\nDirectory for cache files. Must have write permissions.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\nexport APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n```\n```\n\nUse language-appropriate naming conventions in examples while maintaining universal documentation structure.\n\n## Integration with Development Workflow\n\n### During Planning\n\nWhen assigned a workscope, identify specification update requirements:\n- Review tasks for configuration, environment, or interface changes\n- Note which specifications need updates\n- Include specification updates in execution plan\n\n### During Execution\n\nImplement code first to understand exact behavior, then update specifications immediately. Maintain synchronization as you work rather than batch updates at the end.\n\n### Before Completion\n\nVerify all specifications are synchronized:\n- Check that every code change has corresponding documentation\n- Run drift detection if available\n- Document specification updates in Work Journal\n\nWorkscopes involving code changes are incomplete until specifications are updated. Documentation-Steward agents may review specification synchronization during quality assurance.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nA workscope with code changes is complete only when:\n\n1. Code changes are implemented and tested\n2. All affected specifications are updated\n3. Specifications accurately describe implementation\n4. Drift verification passes (manual or automated)\n5. Work Journal documents specification changes\n\nAttempting to complete a workscope without specification updates violates Agent Rule 3.11 and will result in workscope rejection.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Forgetting Specifications Exist\n\nAgents implement features but forget specification documents need updates.\n\n**Solution**: Review specification requirements during workscope planning. Include specification tasks in execution plan before beginning implementation.\n\n### Partial Updates\n\nAgents update one specification but miss related specifications. Adding a configuration option controlled by a CLI flag requires updating both configuration and CLI specifications.\n\n**Solution**: Map features to all affected specifications. Configuration options often have CLI flag overrides and environment variable overrides. Update all three.\n\n### Migration Notes in Specifications\n\n**Solution**: Write specifications as if features always worked the current way. No migration notes, no old behavior references. For pre-release projects, the new design is the only design.\n\n### Drift After Updates\n\nSpecifications updated but drift detection still reports issues.\n\n**Solution**: Verify exact names match between spec and code. Check for typos. Ensure code actually uses documented features. Confirm specification formatting matches project patterns.\n\n### Mismatched Structure\n\nSpecifications organized differently from code makes alignment difficult.\n\n**Solution**: Mirror code organization in specifications where practical. Group related configuration options as they appear in code. Cross-reference between specifications when features span multiple specs.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example: Adding Configuration Option\n\n**Task**: Add automatic cache cleanup option.\n\n**Code (Python)**:\n```python\ndef get_default_config():\n    return {\n        \"cache\": {\n            \"max_size\": 1000,\n            \"auto_clean\": True  # NEW\n        }\n    }\n\n# In cache implementation\nif config[\"cache\"][\"auto_clean\"]:\n    self._clean_expired()\n```\n\n**Code (TypeScript)**:\n```typescript\nconst defaultConfig = {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: 1000,\n    autoClean: true  // NEW\n  }\n};\n\n// In cache implementation\nif (config.cache.autoClean) {\n  this.cleanExpired();\n}\n```\n\n**Specification Update**:\n```markdown\n### cache.auto_clean / cache.autoClean\n\n**Type**: Boolean\n**Default**: `true`\n\nEnable automatic cleanup of expired cache entries. When enabled, cache removes expired entries during read operations. When disabled, expired entries remain until manual cleanup.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nconfig = {\"cache\": {\"auto_clean\": False}}\n```\n\n```typescript\nconst config = {cache: {autoClean: false}};\n```\n```\n\n### Example: Adding Environment Variable\n\n**Task**: Allow cache directory override via environment.\n\n**Code (Python)**:\n```python\ncache_dir = os.getenv(\"APP_CACHE_DIR\", \"/tmp/cache\")\n```\n\n**Code (TypeScript)**:\n```typescript\nconst cacheDir = process.env.APP_CACHE_DIR ?? \"/tmp/cache\";\n```\n\n**Specification Update**:\n```markdown\n### APP_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n\nOverride cache directory location. Must be writable directory. Application creates directory if it doesn't exist.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\nexport APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n```\n\n**Precedence**: Overrides cache directory from configuration files.\n```\n\n### Example: Removing Feature\n\n**Task**: Remove deprecated legacy mode flag.\n\n**Code Changes**: Delete flag from parser, remove checks from code.\n\n**Specification Update**: Remove entire section documenting the flag.\n\n**Verification**: Confirm no code references remain. Confirm specification no longer mentions removed feature. Run drift detection to verify no dead documentation.\n\n## Related Standards\n\n- Agent Rule 3.11 mandates specification updates with code changes\n- Coding Standards require documentation for all public interfaces\n- Test standards require specification accuracy verification\n\n---\n\n**Key Insight**: Specifications are sources of truth.

These standards ensure that tests are deterministic, reproducible, and independent of developer machine configuration.\n\n### Core Principle\n\n**Tests must pass identically on any machine, regardless of local environment configuration.**\n\nA test suite that depends on a developer's specific setup is not truly automated—it's a source of false failures, CI/CD instability, and developer friction.\n\n## Why Test Isolation Matters\n\n### Problems Caused by Poor Isolation\n\n1. **Non-deterministic failures**: Tests pass on one machine, fail on another\n2. **CI/CD brittleness**: Build servers require special configuration to match developer environments\n3. **Onboarding friction**: New developers encounter mysterious test failures\n4. **Hidden bugs**: Tests may pass due to \"lucky\" local config, hiding real issues\n5. **Debugging overhead**: Hours wasted investigating environment-dependent failures\n\n### Benefits of Proper Isolation\n\n1. **Confidence**: Green tests mean the code works, red tests mean it doesn't\n2. **Portability**: Tests run anywhere—local machines, CI/CD, containers\n3. **Maintainability**: Tests explicitly declare their dependencies\n4. **Debugging**: Failures are reproducible and clearly caused by code changes\n\n## Standard 1: Environment Variable Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Every test must explicitly control its environment variables.**\n\nTests fall into two categories:\n\n#### 1A: Tests of Default Behavior (No Environment Variables Set)\n\nThese tests verify behavior when environment variables are NOT set. They must clear the environment:\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nimport pytest\n\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)\ndef test_default_cache_directory():\n    \"\"\"Test default behavior when SERVICE_CACHE_DIR is not set.\"\"\"\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-id\")\n    cache_dir = client.get_cache_directory()\n\n    # Now we KNOW SERVICE_CACHE_DIR was not set\n    assert cache_dir == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"external_service\"\n```\n\n**Why**: Without `clear=True`, the test inherits the developer's shell environment, making it non-deterministic.\n\n#### 1B: Tests of Environment-Dependent Behavior\n\nThese tests verify behavior when specific environment variables ARE set. They must explicitly set only what's needed:\n\n```python\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {\"SERVICE_CACHE_DIR\": \"/custom/path\"})\ndef test_custom_cache_directory():\n    \"\"\"Test behavior when SERVICE_CACHE_DIR is explicitly set.\"\"\"\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-id\")\n    cache_dir = client.get_cache_directory()\n\n    # Now we KNOW exactly what SERVICE_CACHE_DIR is\n    assert cache_dir == Path(\"/custom/path\")\n```\n\n### Common Environment Variables in Python Projects\n\nWhen testing code that reads these variables, always use `@patch.dict`:\n\n- **API credentials**: `API_KEY`, `SERVICE_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL` - Must be mocked unless in opt-in integration tests\n- **Service endpoints**: `API_ENDPOINT`, `DATABASE_HOST`, `REDIS_URL` - Must be controlled\n- **Directory paths**: `HOME`, `CACHE_DIR`, `DATA_PATH`, `LOG_DIR` - Must be explicitly set or cleared\n- **Configuration files**: `CONFIG_FILE`, `SETTINGS_PATH` - Must be controlled, typically with `tmp_path`\n- **Feature flags**: `ENABLE_FEATURE_X`, `DEBUG_MODE`, `EXPERIMENTAL` - Must be explicitly set\n- **Runtime environment**: `ENVIRONMENT`, `STAGE`, `NODE_ENV` - Must be controlled for deterministic behavior\n\n### Anti-Pattern Example\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: This test will fail if developer has SERVICE_CACHE_DIR set\ndef test_default_cache_directory():\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-id\")\n    cache_dir = client.get_cache_directory()\n    assert cache_dir == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"external_service\"\n```\n\n### Correct Pattern\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Environment is explicitly controlled\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)\ndef test_default_cache_directory():\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-id\")\n    cache_dir = client.get_cache_directory()\n    assert cache_dir == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"external_service\"\n```\n\n## Standard 2: File System Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Tests must never read from or write to actual user directories.**\n\n### Use pytest tmp_path Fixture\n\nAll file operations should use temporary directories:\n\n```python\ndef test_config_file_loading(tmp_path: Path):\n    \"\"\"Test configuration file loading.\"\"\"\n    # Create temporary config file\n    config_file = tmp_path / \"config.toml\"\n    config_file.write_text(\"[settings]\\ntheme = dark\\nlog_level = info\")\n\n    # Test with temporary file\n    config = AppConfig.load(config_file)\n    assert config.get(\"theme\") == \"dark\"\n```\n\n### Never Access Real User Directories\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Reads from actual user config directory\ndef test_config_loading():\n    config_path = Path.home() / \".config\" / \"myapp\" / \"config.toml\"\n    config = AppConfig.load(config_path)\n    # What if user doesn't have this file? Or has different settings?\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Uses temporary directory\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {\"CONFIG_HOME\": str(tmp_path)})\ndef test_config_loading(tmp_path: Path):\n    config_file = tmp_path / \"config.toml\"\n    config_file.write_text(\"[settings]\\ntheme = dark\\nlog_level = info\")\n    config = AppConfig.load(config_file)\n```\n\n### Test Fixtures Location\n\nPermanent test data files belong in `tests/test_data/`:\n\n```\ntests/\n├── test_data/\n│   ├── sample_config.toml\n│   ├── external_model_data.json\n│   └── gguf/\n│       └── minimal_test.gguf\n```\n\nThese are **version-controlled fixtures**, not developer configuration files.\n\n## Standard 3: Configuration File Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Tests must never depend on developer's actual configuration files.**\n\n### Pattern: Mock Config Loading\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import Mock, patch\n\ndef test_cli_with_config():\n    \"\"\"Test CLI behavior with configuration.\"\"\"\n    # Create mock config in memory\n    mock_config = Mock()\n    mock_config.get = Mock(side_effect=lambda k: {\"theme\": \"dark\", \"debug\": True}.get(k))\n\n    with patch('myapp.config.AppConfig.load', return_value=mock_config):\n        result = runner.invoke(cli, [\"process\", \"--verbose\"])\n        assert result.exit_code == 0\n```\n\n### Pattern: Temporary Config Files\n\n```python\ndef test_config_manager_platform_specific(tmp_path: Path):\n    \"\"\"Test platform-specific config paths.\"\"\"\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, {\"CONFIG_HOME\": str(tmp_path)}, clear=True):\n        config_path = tmp_path / \"config.toml\"\n        config_path.write_text(\"[aliases]\\nshortcut = full-command --with-args\")\n\n        config = AppConfig.load()\n        assert config.get_aliases() == {\"shortcut\": \"full-command --with-args\"}\n```\n\n### Never Test Against Real User Files\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Depends on developer's actual .env file\ndef test_api_key_discovery():\n    keys = discover_api_keys()\n    assert \"API_KEY\" in keys\n    # What if developer doesn't have this key? Or has a different one?\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Creates controlled test environment\ndef test_api_key_discovery(tmp_path: Path):\n    env_file = tmp_path / \".env\"\n    env_file.write_text(\"API_KEY=test-key-12345\")\n\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, {\"CONFIG_HOME\": str(tmp_path)}, clear=True):\n        keys = discover_api_keys()\n        assert keys[\"API_KEY\"] == \"test-key-12345\"\n```\n\n## Standard 4: Network Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Unit tests must mock all network calls. Integration tests requiring network must be opt-in.**\n\n### Unit Tests: Always Mock Network\n\n```python\nfrom unittest.mock import Mock, patch\n\ndef test_anthropic_tokenization():\n    \"\"\"Test Anthropic tokenization (mocked).\"\"\"\n    # Mock the API response\n    with patch('requests.post') as mock_post:\n        mock_post.return_value.json.return_value = {\n            \"token_count\": 42\n        }\n\n        tokenizer = AnthropicTokenizer(\"claude-3-opus-20240229\")\n        count = tokenizer.count_tokens(\"Hello world\")\n\n        assert count == 42\n        # Verify API was called correctly\n        mock_post.assert_called_once()\n```\n\n### Integration Tests: Opt-in with Markers\n\nFor tests that genuinely need network access:\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.network\n@pytest.mark.skipif(not os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"), reason=\"API key required\")\ndef test_anthropic_api_integration():\n    \"\"\"Integration test with real Anthropic API.\"\"\"\n    tokenizer = AnthropicTokenizer(\"claude-3-opus-20240229\")\n    count = tokenizer.count_tokens(\"Hello world\")\n    assert count > 0\n```\n\nRun these explicitly:\n```bash\n# Skip by default\npytest  # Network tests skipped\n\n# Run explicitly\npytest --network  # Or custom marker setup\npytest -m network\n```\n\n### Example Pattern: --with-api-keys Flag\n\nExample implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\n# tests/conftest.py\ndef pytest_addoption(parser):\n    parser.addoption(\n        \"--with-api-keys\",\n        action=\"store_true\",\n        default=False,\n        help=\"Run tests requiring real API keys\"\n    )\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef api_keys_available(request):\n    if not request.config.getoption(\"--with-api-keys\"):\n        pytest.skip(\"Test requires --with-api-keys flag\")\n```\n\nThis is the correct pattern. **Extend it to all network-dependent tests.**\n\n## Standard 5: Test Categories and Isolation Levels\n\n### Unit Tests (Default)\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- No network access (mock all external APIs)\n- No file system access to user directories (use `tmp_path`)\n- No environment variable dependencies (use `@patch.dict`)\n- Fast execution (milliseconds)\n- No external dependencies\n\n**Isolation Requirements:**\n- ✅ Environment variables cleared or explicitly set\n- ✅ File system isolated to temporary directories\n- ✅ Network calls mocked\n- ✅ No reading from actual config files\n\n**Run by default:**\n```bash\npytest  # Runs all unit tests\n```\n\n### Integration Tests (Opt-in)\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- May use real network calls to test actual API integration\n- Still use controlled environments (not developer's personal config)\n- May require API keys or other credentials\n- Slower execution (seconds)\n\n**Isolation Requirements:**\n- ✅ API keys provided via test fixtures or temporary env vars\n- ✅ File system still isolated to temporary directories\n- ✅ Network calls allowed but to real endpoints\n- ❌ No mocking of core functionality being tested\n\n**Run explicitly:**\n```bash\npytest --with-api-keys\npytest -m integration\n```\n\n### End-to-End Tests (Rare, Opt-in)\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Test complete user workflows\n- May read from actual installed configuration (if testing installation)\n- Much slower execution (seconds to minutes)\n\n**Isolation Requirements:**\n- ⚠️ May use some real environment, but document requirements\n- ✅ Should not assume any particular user configuration\n- ✅ Should clean up after themselves\n\n**Run explicitly:**\n```bash\npytest --e2e\npytest -m e2e\n```\n\n## Standard 6: Common Patterns and Fixtures\n\n### Standard Fixture: Isolated Environment\n\nCreate reusable fixtures for common isolation needs:\n\n```python\n# tests/conftest.py\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef clean_env():\n    \"\"\"Provide a completely clean environment.\"\"\"\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True):\n        yield\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef isolated_app_env(tmp_path):\n    \"\"\"Provide isolated application environment with temp directories.\"\"\"\n    env = {\n        \"CONFIG_HOME\": str(tmp_path / \"config\"),\n        \"CACHE_HOME\": str(tmp_path / \"cache\"),\n        \"DATA_HOME\": str(tmp_path / \"data\"),\n    }\n\n    # Create directories\n    for path_str in env.values():\n        Path(path_str).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, env, clear=True):\n        yield tmp_path\n```\n\nUsage:\n```python\ndef test_config_isolation(isolated_app_env):\n    \"\"\"Test runs in completely isolated application environment.\"\"\"\n    config_file = isolated_app_env / \"config\" / \"config.toml\"\n    config_file.write_text(\"[settings]\\nmode = test\")\n\n    # Config will be loaded from isolated environment\n    config = AppConfig.load()\n    assert config.get(\"mode\") == \"test\"\n```\n\n### Standard Fixture: Mock API Keys\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef mock_api_keys(monkeypatch):\n    \"\"\"Provide mock API credentials for testing.\"\"\"\n    keys = {\n        \"API_KEY\": \"test-api-key-12345\",\n        \"SERVICE_TOKEN\": \"test-token-67890\",\n        \"DATABASE_URL\": \"sqlite:///:memory:\",\n    }\n    for key, value in keys.items():\n        monkeypatch.setenv(key, value)\n    yield keys\n```\n\n## Standard 7: Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### ❌ Assuming Clean Environment\n\n```python\n# BAD: Assumes HF_HOME is not set\ndef test_default_behavior():\n    result = get_cache_dir()\n    assert result == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"huggingface\"\n```\n\n### ✅ Explicitly Ensuring Clean Environment\n\n```python\n# GOOD: Guarantees HF_HOME is not set\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)\ndef test_default_behavior():\n    result = get_cache_dir()\n    assert result == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"huggingface\"\n```\n\n### ❌ Reading Real User Files\n\n```python\n# BAD: Reads from actual user directory\ndef test_config_loading():\n    config = load_config(Path.home() / \".config\" / \"myapp\" / \"config.toml\")\n    assert config.get(\"theme\") == \"dark\"\n```\n\n### ✅ Using Temporary Files\n\n```python\n# GOOD: Creates temporary config\ndef test_config_loading(tmp_path):\n    config_file = tmp_path / \"config.toml\"\n    config_file.write_text(\"[settings]\\ntheme = dark\\nlog_level = info\")\n    config = load_config(config_file)\n    assert config.get(\"theme\") == \"dark\"\n```\n\n### ❌ Unmocked Network Calls in Unit Tests\n\n```python\n# BAD: Makes real network call\ndef test_fetch_models():\n    models = fetch_models_from_api()\n    assert len(models) > 0\n```\n\n### ✅ Mocked Network Calls\n\n```python\n# GOOD: Mocks network call\n@patch('requests.get')\ndef test_fetch_models(mock_get):\n    mock_get.return_value.json.return_value = {\"models\": [\"gpt-4\", \"gpt-3.5\"]}\n    models = fetch_models_from_api()\n    assert models == [\"gpt-4\", \"gpt-3.5\"]\n```\n\n### ❌ Partial Environment Patching\n\n```python\n# BAD: Only patches one variable, leaves others from shell\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {\"CONFIG_FILE\": \"/tmp/config.toml\"})\ndef test_with_config():\n    # SERVICE_CACHE_DIR, API_KEY, etc. still leak from shell!\n    ...\n```\n\n### ✅ Complete Environment Control\n\n```python\n# GOOD: Clears everything, sets only what's needed\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {\"CONFIG_FILE\": \"/tmp/config.toml\"}, clear=True)\ndef test_with_config():\n    # Only CONFIG_FILE is set, everything else is clean\n    ...\n```\n\n## Standard 8: Case Study - Environment Variable Isolation\n\n> **Note**: This case study uses a real example involving an external service's cache directory environment variable. While the specific variable name is from one project, the isolation pattern demonstrated here applies to any environment-dependent behavior in your code.\n\n### The Problem\n\nTest: `tests/test_huggingface_coverage.py::test_get_cache_dir_default`\n\n```python\n# Original test (WRONG)\ndef test_get_cache_dir_default(self, mock_auto_tokenizer):\n    \"\"\"Test default cache directory.\"\"\"\n    tokenizer = HuggingFaceTokenizer(\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\")\n    cache_dir = tokenizer._get_cache_dir()\n    assert cache_dir == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"huggingface\" / \"hub\"\n```\n\n**Failure**: When developer runs `HF_HOME=env/hf_home pytest`, test fails because:\n1. Test assumes `HF_HOME` is not set\n2. Test doesn't isolate environment\n3. Code correctly reads `HF_HOME` from shell\n4. Test gets `env/hf_home/hub` instead of default path\n\n**This is a test isolation bug, not a code bug.** The code correctly reads the environment variable; the test incorrectly assumed it wasn't set.\n\n### The Fix\n\n```python\n# Corrected test\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)\ndef test_get_cache_dir_default(self, mock_auto_tokenizer):\n    \"\"\"Test default cache directory when HF_HOME is not set.\"\"\"\n    tokenizer = HuggingFaceTokenizer(\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\")\n    cache_dir = tokenizer._get_cache_dir()\n    assert cache_dir == Path.home() / \".cache\" / \"huggingface\" / \"hub\"\n```\n\nNow the test:\n- Explicitly clears environment, ensuring `HF_HOME` is not set\n- Tests exactly what it claims to test (default behavior)\n- Passes regardless of developer's shell environment\n\n### Comparison: The Custom Path Test\n\nThe sibling test already does this correctly:\n\n```python\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {\"HF_HOME\": \"/custom/hf/home\"})\ndef test_get_cache_dir_custom(self, mock_auto_tokenizer):\n    \"\"\"Test custom cache directory from environment.\"\"\"\n    tokenizer = HuggingFaceTokenizer(\"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\")\n    cache_dir = tokenizer._get_cache_dir()\n    assert cache_dir == Path(\"/custom/hf/home\") / \"hub\"\n```\n\nThis test works because it explicitly sets `HF_HOME` to a known value.\n\n## Standard 9: Cache State Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Tests must not depend on existing cache state and must clean up after execution.**\n\nCache pollution is a common source of test interdependence. One test populates the cache, and subsequent tests unexpectedly find cached data instead of exercising fresh code paths.\n\n### The Problem\n\nPython applications commonly have multiple caches that can affect test behavior:\n- **External data cache** - Downloaded resources, API responses, computed results\n- **Session cache** - User sessions, authentication tokens, temporary state\n- **Build cache** - Compiled artifacts, processed assets, generated files\n- **Application cache** - Business logic caching, memoization, computed values\n\n### Pattern: Isolated Cache Directories\n\nUse temporary cache directories for each test:\n\n```python\ndef test_resource_download(tmp_path: Path):\n    \"\"\"Test resource download with isolated cache.\"\"\"\n    cache_dir = tmp_path / \"service_cache\"\n\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, {\"SERVICE_CACHE_DIR\": str(cache_dir)}, clear=True):\n        client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-identifier\")\n        # This test has its own cache, won't interfere with others\n        assert client.is_cached() is False\n```\n\n### Pattern: Clear Cache Before Test\n\nFor tests that must use a specific cache location:\n\n```python\ndef test_cache_loading(tmp_path: Path):\n    \"\"\"Test loading from cache.\"\"\"\n    cache_dir = tmp_path / \"cache\"\n    cache_dir.mkdir()\n\n    # Explicitly populate cache with known data\n    cache_file = cache_dir / \"test_model.cache\"\n    cache_file.write_text('{\"tokens\": 100}')\n\n    # Test uses only the cache we created\n    result = load_from_cache(cache_file)\n    assert result[\"tokens\"] == 100\n```\n\n### Anti-Pattern Examples\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Assumes cache is empty\ndef test_cache_miss():\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-identifier\")\n    # Fails if another test or developer has this resource cached!\n    assert client.is_cached() is False\n\n# ❌ BAD: Pollutes shared cache\ndef test_cache_writing():\n    # Uses default cache location\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-identifier\")\n    client.download()\n    # Leaves cache in modified state for other tests!\n\n# ❌ BAD: Depends on cache from previous test\ndef test_cache_hit():\n    # Assumes test_cache_writing ran first\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-identifier\")\n    assert client.is_cached() is True\n```\n\n### Correct Patterns\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Isolated cache\n@patch.dict(os.environ, {\"SERVICE_CACHE_DIR\": str(tmp_path / \"cache\")}, clear=True)\ndef test_cache_miss(tmp_path: Path):\n    client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-identifier\")\n    # Fresh cache, known state\n    assert client.is_cached() is False\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Explicit cache setup\ndef test_cache_hit(tmp_path: Path):\n    cache_dir = tmp_path / \"cache\" / \"resources\"\n    cache_dir.mkdir(parents=True)\n\n    # Explicitly create cache state\n    resource_dir = cache_dir / \"resource-identifier\"\n    resource_dir.mkdir()\n    # ... populate with known cached data\n\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, {\"SERVICE_CACHE_DIR\": str(tmp_path / \"cache\")}, clear=True):\n        client = ExternalServiceClient(\"resource-identifier\")\n        assert client.is_cached() is True\n```\n\n### Common Cache Patterns\n\nWhen testing cache-related functionality, isolate these:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef isolated_caches(tmp_path: Path):\n    \"\"\"Provide isolated cache directories for testing.\"\"\"\n    env = {\n        \"CACHE_HOME\": str(tmp_path / \"cache\"),\n        \"DATA_CACHE_DIR\": str(tmp_path / \"data_cache\"),\n        \"SESSION_CACHE_DIR\": str(tmp_path / \"session_cache\"),\n    }\n\n    # Create directories\n    for path_str in env.values():\n        Path(path_str).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)\n\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, env, clear=True):\n        yield tmp_path\n```\n\n## Standard 10: Global State and Singleton Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Tests must reset global state and singletons before/after execution.**\n\nGlobal state creates hidden dependencies between tests. One test modifies a singleton, and subsequent tests inherit that modified state.\n\n### Common Problems in Python Applications\n\nPython applications commonly have global state concerns:\n\n1. **Provider Registry** - Singleton that registers available providers\n2. **Tokenizer Instances** - May be cached/reused\n3. **Module-level Configuration** - Settings loaded at import time\n\n### Pattern: Reset Singletons\n\n```python\ndef test_service_registration():\n    \"\"\"Test service registration in isolation.\"\"\"\n    # Reset registry to known state\n    from myapp.services import ServiceRegistry\n\n    # Save original state\n    original_services = ServiceRegistry._services.copy()\n\n    try:\n        # Test with clean registry\n        ServiceRegistry._services.clear()\n        ServiceRegistry.register(\"custom\", CustomService)\n        assert \"custom\" in ServiceRegistry.list_services()\n    finally:\n        # Restore original state\n        ServiceRegistry._services = original_services\n```\n\n### Pattern: Fixture for State Cleanup\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef clean_service_registry():\n    \"\"\"Ensure clean service registry for test.\"\"\"\n    from myapp.services import ServiceRegistry\n\n    original = ServiceRegistry._services.copy()\n    yield\n    ServiceRegistry._services = original\n\ndef test_with_clean_registry(clean_service_registry):\n    \"\"\"Test runs with isolated registry state.\"\"\"\n    # Registry is cleaned before and after this test\n    ...\n```\n\n### Anti-Pattern Examples\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Modifies global registry\ndef test_add_service():\n    ServiceRegistry.register(\"test\", TestService)\n    # Leaves registry in modified state!\n\n# ❌ BAD: Depends on global state from other test\ndef test_service_exists():\n    # Assumes test_add_service ran first\n    assert \"test\" in ServiceRegistry.list_services()\n\n# ❌ BAD: Module-level side effects\nimport myapp.config\nmyapp.config.DEFAULT_MODE = \"custom\"  # Affects all tests!\n\ndef test_something():\n    # This test and all subsequent tests see modified default\n    ...\n```\n\n### Correct Patterns\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Isolated registry modification\ndef test_add_service(clean_service_registry):\n    ServiceRegistry.register(\"test\", TestService)\n    assert \"test\" in ServiceRegistry.list_services()\n    # Fixture cleans up after\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Mock global config\ndef test_with_custom_default():\n    with patch('myapp.config.DEFAULT_MODE', 'custom'):\n        # Only this test sees modified default\n        assert get_default_mode() == 'custom'\n```\n\n### Important: Module Import Side Effects\n\nBe aware of code that executes at import time:\n\n```python\n# In module code (BAD pattern to avoid):\nDEFAULT_CONFIG = load_config()  # Runs at import!\n\n# Tests will inherit whatever state this creates\n```\n\nIf such code exists, tests must account for it:\n\n```python\ndef test_something():\n    # Reset module-level state\n    import myapp.some_module\n    importlib.reload(myapp.some_module)  # Careful: expensive!\n\n    # Or better: refactor module to avoid import-time side effects\n```\n\n## Standard 11: Working Directory Isolation\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Tests must not assume they run from a specific working directory.**\n\nTests that use relative paths fail when run from different directories (IDE, CI/CD, different developer setups).\n\n### The Problem\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Assumes running from project root\ndef test_load_fixture():\n    data = load_json(\"tests/test_data/sample.json\")\n    # Fails if run from tests/ directory or elsewhere\n```\n\n### Pattern: Use `__file__` for Paths\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Path relative to test file location\ndef test_load_fixture():\n    test_dir = Path(__file__).parent\n    fixture_path = test_dir / \"test_data\" / \"sample.json\"\n    data = load_json(fixture_path)\n```\n\n### Pattern: Use Fixtures for Test Data Paths\n\n```python\n# tests/conftest.py\n@pytest.fixture\ndef test_data_dir():\n    \"\"\"Provide path to test data directory.\"\"\"\n    return Path(__file__).parent / \"test_data\"\n\n# tests/test_something.py\ndef test_load_sample(test_data_dir: Path):\n    \"\"\"Test loading sample data.\"\"\"\n    data = load_json(test_data_dir / \"sample.json\")\n    assert data[\"version\"] == 1\n```\n\n### Anti-Pattern Examples\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Relative path from unknown location\ndef test_data_loading():\n    data = load_data(\"tests/test_data/fixtures/sample_data.json\")\n\n# ❌ BAD: Assumes CWD is project root\ndef test_config_loading():\n    with open(\"src/myapp/data/metadata.json\") as f:\n        data = json.load(f)\n\n# ❌ BAD: Changes working directory without cleanup\ndef test_something():\n    os.chdir(\"tests\")\n    # Other tests now run from wrong directory!\n    ...\n```\n\n### Correct Patterns\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Absolute path from test location\ndef test_data_loading():\n    test_dir = Path(__file__).parent\n    data_path = test_dir / \"test_data\" / \"fixtures\" / \"sample_data.json\"\n    data = load_data(data_path)\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Use package resources for package data\nfrom importlib.resources import files\ndef test_metadata_loading():\n    metadata = files(\"myapp.data\").joinpath(\"metadata.json\")\n    with metadata.open() as f:\n        data = json.load(f)\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Change directory with cleanup\ndef test_with_different_cwd(tmp_path: Path):\n    original_cwd = Path.cwd()\n    try:\n        os.chdir(tmp_path)\n        # Test that needs specific CWD\n        ...\n    finally:\n        os.chdir(original_cwd)\n```\n\n### Example Test Data Organization\n\nExample test data organization in `tests/test_data/`:\n\n```\ntests/\n├── test_data/\n│   ├── fixtures/          # Version-controlled test inputs\n│   │   ├── sample_data.json\n│   │   ├── test_config.toml\n│   │   └── valid_input.csv\n│   ├── expected/          # Expected outputs for verification\n│   │   ├── processed_result.json\n│   │   └── formatted_output.txt\n│   └── mocks/             # Mock API responses\n│       ├── api_success.json\n│       └── api_error.json\n└── test_*.py\n```\n\nAccess these with path relative to test file:\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef sample_data_file():\n    \"\"\"Provide path to sample data fixture.\"\"\"\n    tests_dir = Path(__file__).parent\n    return tests_dir / \"test_data\" / \"fixtures\" / \"sample_data.json\"\n```\n\n## Standard 12: Standard Stream Isolation (CLI Testing)\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**CLI tests must properly capture and isolate stdout/stderr output.**\n\nCLI applications write to stdout/stderr. Tests must capture this output without interference between tests.\n\n### The Problem\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Output goes to console\ndef test_cli_help():\n    cli_main([\"--help\"])\n    # How do we verify what was printed?\n    # Output visible in test runner, pollutes output\n```\n\n### Pattern: Use pytest's capsys\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Capture output with capsys\ndef test_cli_help(capsys):\n    \"\"\"Test CLI help output.\"\"\"\n    with pytest.raises(SystemExit):  # --help exits\n        cli_main([\"--help\"])\n\n    captured = capsys.readouterr()\n    assert \"usage:\" in captured.out.lower()\n    assert \"show this help message\" in captured.out.lower()\n```\n\n### Pattern: Use Typer's CliRunner (Recommended for Typer apps)\n\nFor Python CLIs using Typer, which provides a testing utility:\n\n```python\nfrom typer.testing import CliRunner\nfrom myapp.cli import app\n\nrunner = CliRunner()\n\ndef test_version_command():\n    \"\"\"Test version command output.\"\"\"\n    result = runner.invoke(app, [\"--version\"])\n\n    assert result.exit_code == 0\n    assert \"version\" in result.stdout.lower()\n```\n\n### Pattern: Mixing Output Capture\n\n```python\ndef test_cli_with_file_output(tmp_path: Path, capsys):\n    \"\"\"Test CLI that writes to both file and stdout.\"\"\"\n    output_file = tmp_path / \"output.txt\"\n\n    result = runner.invoke(app, [\n        \"hello world\",\n        \"--output\", str(output_file)\n    ])\n\n    # Verify CLI output\n    assert result.exit_code == 0\n\n    # Verify file was written\n    assert output_file.exists()\n    assert \"token\" in output_file.read_text()\n\n    # Verify nothing leaked to stderr\n    assert result.stderr == \"\"\n```\n\n### Anti-Pattern Examples\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Doesn't capture output\ndef test_cli_output():\n    cli_main([\"hello\"])\n    # No way to verify output!\n\n# ❌ BAD: Manual stdout redirection (fragile)\ndef test_cli_manual_capture():\n    old_stdout = sys.stdout\n    sys.stdout = io.StringIO()\n    try:\n        cli_main([\"hello\"])\n        output = sys.stdout.getvalue()\n    finally:\n        sys.stdout = old_stdout\n    # Fragile, doesn't handle stderr, can leave stdout corrupted\n\n# ❌ BAD: Output interference\ndef test_something():\n    print(\"Debug info\")  # Pollutes test output!\n```\n\n### Correct Patterns\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: CliRunner captures everything\ndef test_error_messages():\n    \"\"\"Test that errors are properly reported.\"\"\"\n    result = runner.invoke(app, [\"--model\", \"nonexistent\"])\n\n    assert result.exit_code != 0\n    assert \"error\" in result.stdout.lower()\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Use pytest's capsys for non-CLI code\ndef test_formatter_output(capsys):\n    \"\"\"Test formatter writes to stdout.\"\"\"\n    formatter = OutputFormatter()\n    formatter.print_result({\"tokens\": 42})\n\n    captured = capsys.readouterr()\n    assert \"42\" in captured.out\n\n# ✅ GOOD: Suppress output when not testing it\ndef test_cli_exit_code():\n    \"\"\"Test only exit code, ignore output.\"\"\"\n    result = runner.invoke(app, [\"hello\"], catch_exceptions=False)\n    assert result.exit_code == 0\n    # Don't check output, just success/failure\n```\n\n### Python CLI Testing Best Practices\n\n```python\n# Standard test setup for Python CLI tests\nfrom typer.testing import CliRunner\nfrom myapp.cli import app\n\nrunner = CliRunner()\n\ndef test_basic_tokenization():\n    \"\"\"Test basic token counting.\"\"\"\n    result = runner.invoke(app, [\n        \"Hello, world!\",\n        \"--provider\", \"openai\",\n        \"--model\", \"gpt-4\"\n    ])\n\n    assert result.exit_code == 0\n    assert \"tokens\" in result.stdout.lower()\n\ndef test_cli_with_config(tmp_path: Path):\n    \"\"\"Test CLI with custom config.\"\"\"\n    config_file = tmp_path / \"config.toml\"\n    config_file.write_text(\"[settings]\\nlog_level = debug\")\n\n    with patch.dict(os.environ, {\"CONFIG_FILE\": str(config_file)}, clear=True):\n        result = runner.invoke(app, [\"run\"])\n        assert result.exit_code == 0\n```\n\n## Standard 13: Module-Level Derived Constant Patching\n\n### Mandatory Practice\n\n**Tests that patch module-level constants must patch all derived constants in the dependency chain.**\n\nPython evaluates module-level expressions once at import time. Constants derived from other constants capture a snapshot of their base value—patching the base constant later does not update derived constants.\n\n### The Problem\n\n```python\n# In module code:\nPROJECT_ROOT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent\nREPORTS_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / \"docs\" / \"reports\"      # Evaluated ONCE at import\nDEV_REPORTS_DIR = PROJECT_ROOT / \"dev\" / \"reports\"   # Evaluated ONCE at import\n```\n\nWhen you patch `PROJECT_ROOT`, `REPORTS_DIR` and `DEV_REPORTS_DIR` still point to their original computed values. Tests using these derived constants will write to real directories.\n\n### Anti-Pattern: Patching Only the Base Constant\n\n```python\n# ❌ BAD: Only patches base constant\ndef test_generate_docs(tmp_path: Path):\n    with patch.object(my_module, \"PROJECT_ROOT\", tmp_path):\n        # REPORTS_DIR still points to real directory!\n        result = my_module.generate_report()\n```\n\n### Correct Pattern: Patch All Constants in the Chain\n\n```python\n# ✅ GOOD: Patches base AND all derived constants\ndef test_generate_docs(tmp_path: Path, monkeypatch):\n    monkeypatch.setattr(my_module, \"PROJECT_ROOT\", tmp_path)\n    monkeypatch.setattr(my_module, \"REPORTS_DIR\", tmp_path / \"docs\" / \"reports\")\n    monkeypatch.setattr(my_module, \"DEV_REPORTS_DIR\", tmp_path / \"dev\" / \"reports\")\n\n    result = my_module.generate_report()\n    # Now writes to tmp_path, not real directories\n```\n\n### Finding Constants to Patch\n\nBefore writing a test that patches any path constant:\n\n1. **Identify the base constant** you need to patch (e.g., `PROJECT_ROOT`)\n2. **Search the module** for constants that reference it:\n   ```bash\n   grep \"PROJECT_ROOT\" source/scripts/my_module.py\n   ```\n3. **Patch every constant** in the dependency chain\n\n### Common Patterns\n\n```python\n@pytest.fixture\ndef isolated_project_paths(tmp_path: Path, monkeypatch):\n    \"\"\"Provide isolated project paths for testing.\"\"\"\n    monkeypatch.setattr(my_module, \"PROJECT_ROOT\", tmp_path)\n    monkeypatch.setattr(my_module, \"REPORTS_DIR\", tmp_path / \"docs\" / \"reports\")\n    monkeypatch.setattr(my_module, \"DEV_REPORTS_DIR\", tmp_path / \"dev\" / \"reports\")\n\n    # Create directories\n    (tmp_path / \"docs\" / \"reports\").mkdir(parents=True)\n    (tmp_path / \"dev\" / \"reports\").mkdir(parents=True)\n\n    return tmp_path\n\ndef test_with_isolated_paths(isolated_project_paths):\n    \"\"\"Test runs with fully isolated path constants.\"\"\"\n    result = my_module.generate_all_reports()\n    assert result.success\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf a test unexpectedly writes to real directories:\n\n1. **Check which constant the function uses** - It may use a derived constant, not the base\n2. **Verify all derived constants are patched** - Missing even one breaks isolation\n3. **Create directories in tmp_path** - Derived paths may need their directories created\n\n## Future Considerations\n\nThese isolation concerns are lower priority in simpler projects but may become relevant as complexity grows:\n\n### Time and Date Dependencies\n\nIf time-based features are implemented (e.g., timestamped logs, time-sensitive operations):\n\n```python\n# Mock time for deterministic tests\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\n@patch('datetime.datetime')\ndef test_timestamp_generation(mock_datetime):\n    mock_datetime.now.return_value = datetime(2024, 1, 1, 12, 0, 0)\n    # Test runs with frozen time\n    result = generate_report_with_timestamp()\n    assert \"2024-01-01\" in result\n```\n\n### Random Number Generation\n\nIf randomness is introduced (sampling, fuzzing, etc.):\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef test_with_randomness():\n    random.seed(42)  # Deterministic \"random\" behavior\n    result = generate_random_test_cases()\n    assert len(result) == 10  # Always generates same 10\n```\n\n### System Properties (Locale, Timezone)\n\nFor locale-sensitive features:\n\n```python\nimport locale\n\ndef test_number_formatting():\n    with patch.object(locale, 'getlocale', return_value=('en_US', 'UTF-8')):\n        # Test with known locale\n        ...\n```\n\n### Platform-Specific Behavior\n\nExample implementation of cross-platform testing with pytest markers:\n\n```python\n@pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform != \"win32\", reason=\"Windows-only test\")\ndef test_windows_paths():\n    # Test Windows-specific path handling\n    ...\n```\n\n## Enforcement and Compliance\n\n### Required for All New Tests\n\nStarting immediately, all new tests must comply with these standards. Code reviews must verify:\n\n- [ ] Environment variables are explicitly controlled with `@patch.dict`\n- [ ] File operations use `tmp_path` or controlled fixtures\n- [ ] Network calls are mocked in unit tests\n- [ ] Integration tests are marked and opt-in\n- [ ] Tests do not depend on developer's personal configuration\n- [ ] Cache directories are isolated with temporary paths\n- [ ] Global state and singletons are reset before/after tests\n- [ ] Paths use `__file__` or fixtures, not relative to CWD\n- [ ] CLI tests properly capture stdout/stderr output\n- [ ] Module-level derived constants are fully patched\n\n### Existing Test Audit\n\nA separate audit will be conducted to identify non-compliant tests in the existing suite. Violations will be addressed through:\n\n1. Identification phase: Scan all tests for anti-patterns\n2. Prioritization: Fix critical failures first\n3. Systematic remediation: Fix all violations\n4. Verification: Confirm tests pass in various environments\n\n## Summary: The Golden Rules\n\n1. **Default Behavior Tests**: Always use `@patch.dict(os.environ, {}, clear=True)`\n2. **Environment-Dependent Tests**: Always use `@patch.dict(os.environ, {...})` with explicit values\n3. **File Operations**: Always use `tmp_path` fixture\n4. **Network Calls**: Always mock in unit tests; opt-in for integration tests\n5. **Configuration Files**: Never read from actual user directories\n6. **Test Categories**: Clearly separate unit/integration/e2e tests\n7. **Cache Isolation**: Use temporary cache directories, never assume cache state\n8. **Global State**: Reset singletons and global variables before/after tests\n9. **Working Directory**: Use `__file__` or fixtures, never assume CWD\n10. **CLI Output**: Use `CliRunner` or `capsys` to capture stdout/stderr\n11. **Documentation**: Tests must document what environment they assume\n12. **Derived Constants**: Patch all constants in the dependency chain, not just the base\n\n**When in doubt, ask**: \"Would this test pass on a colleague's machine with different environment variables, configuration, cache state, and working directory?\"\n\nIf the answer is no, the test needs better isolation.\n","numLines":1238,"startLine":1,"totalLines":1238}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"56c41061-f151-4c28-a06c-e02cca104cd7"}

The mapping engine supports field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic based on record content or metadata.\n    26→\n    27→**Field Transformation**: Applying transformation operations to individual field values including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformations execute in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent operations.\n    28→\n    29→**Data Enrichment**: Augmenting records with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. The enrichment engine manages cache lifecycle, handles source unavailability gracefully, and tracks enrichment success rates for monitoring.\n    30→\n    31→**Quality Scoring**: Evaluating each record against configurable quality criteria and assigning a numeric score reflecting data completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns.\n    32→\n    33→### Processing Model\n

logic is expressed through declarative rule definitions rather than imperative code, enabling non-developers to understand and modify transformation behavior.\n    63→\n    64→**Idempotent Operations**: All transformations produce identical results when applied to identical inputs, enabling safe retry and replay of failed transformations.\n    65→\n    66→**Preserving Provenance**: The transformation pipeline maintains complete lineage tracking, recording which rules were applied to each field and intermediate values at each stage.\n    67→\n    68→**Graceful Degradation**: When enrichment sources are unavailable or transformation rules encounter unexpected data, the pipeline continues processing with appropriate fallback behavior.\n    69→\n    70→---\n    71→\n    72→## Transformation Pipeline\n    73→\n    74→The transformation pipeline consists of four sequential stages that process records in a defined order.\n    75→\n    76→### Stage 1: Schema Mapping\n    77→\n    78→Schema mapping converts records from Module Alpha's internal format to target schema(s) required by downstream consumers.\n    79→\n    80→**Mapping Operations**:\n    81→\n    82→**Direct Field Mapping**: Copies a source field value to a target field, optionally with type conversion.\n    83→\n    84→**Composite Field Construction**: Combines multiple source fields into a single target field with configurable separators and templates.\n    85→\n    86→**Field Decomposition**: Splits a single source field into multiple target fields using delimiters or patterns.\n    87→\n    88→**Conditional Mapping**: Applies different mapping rules based on source field values or record metadata.\n    89→\n    90→**Default Value Assignment**: Assigns default values when source fields are missing or null.\n    91→\n    92→### Stage 2: Field Transformation\n    93→\n    94→Field transformation applies value-level operations to individual fields after schema mapping.\n    95→\n    96→**String Transformations**: Case conversion, trimming, padding, substring extraction, pattern replacement.\n    97→\n    98→**Numeric Transformations**: Arithmetic operations, rounding, scaling, unit conversion.\n    99→\n   100→**Temporal Transformations**: Date/time parsing, formatting, timezone conversion.\n   101→\n   102→**Lookup Transformations**: Value substitution based on lookup tables.\n   103→\n   104→### Stage 3: Data Enrichment\n   105→\n   106→Data enrichment augments records with information from external sources including reference databases, external APIs, and cache layers.\n   107→\n   108→When an enrichment source is unavailable, the engine applies configured behaviors: FAIL (route to error handling), SKIP (leave empty), DEFAULT (apply defaults), or STALE (use expired cache).\n   109→\n   110→### Stage 4: Quality Scoring\n   111→\n   112→Quality scoring evaluates transformed records and assigns a score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on completeness, consistency, conformance, and timeliness.\n   113→\n   114→---\n   115→\n   116→## Data Structures\n   117→\n   118→Module Beta defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n   119→\n

[Compliance Requirements](#compliance-requirements)\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nModule Beta serves as the data transformation layer of the Data Pipeline System, responsible for converting validated records from Module Alpha into the enriched, normalized format required by Module Gamma for output delivery. As the central processing stage in the pipeline, Module Beta implements comprehensive transformation capabilities including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment, and quality scoring.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Schema Mapping**: Converting records from the internal ingestion format to one or more target output schemas. The mapping engine supports field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic based on record content or metadata.\n\n**Field Transformation**: Applying transformation operations to individual field values including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformations execute in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent operations.\n\n**Data Enrichment**: Augmenting records with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. The enrichment engine manages cache lifecycle, handles source unavailability gracefully, and tracks enrichment success rates for monitoring.\n\n**Quality Scoring**: Evaluating each record against configurable quality criteria and assigning a numeric score reflecting data completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Beta processes records through a multi-stage transformation pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MODULE BETA TRANSFORMATION PIPELINE

declarative rule definitions rather than imperative code, enabling non-developers to understand and modify transformation behavior.\n\n**Idempotent Operations**: All transformations produce identical results when applied to identical inputs, enabling safe retry and replay of failed transformations.\n\n**Preserving Provenance**: The transformation pipeline maintains complete lineage tracking, recording which rules were applied to each field and intermediate values at each stage.\n\n**Graceful Degradation**: When enrichment sources are unavailable or transformation rules encounter unexpected data, the pipeline continues processing with appropriate fallback behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Transformation Pipeline\n\nThe transformation pipeline consists of four sequential stages that process records in a defined order.\n\n### Stage 1: Schema Mapping\n\nSchema mapping converts records from Module Alpha's internal format to target schema(s) required by downstream consumers.\n\n**Mapping Operations**:\n\n**Direct Field Mapping**: Copies a source field value to a target field, optionally with type conversion.\n\n**Composite Field Construction**: Combines multiple source fields into a single target field with configurable separators and templates.\n\n**Field Decomposition**: Splits a single source field into multiple target fields using delimiters or patterns.\n\n**Conditional Mapping**: Applies different mapping rules based on source field values or record metadata.\n\n**Default Value Assignment**: Assigns default values when source fields are missing or null.\n\n### Stage 2: Field Transformation\n\nField transformation applies value-level operations to individual fields after schema mapping.\n\n**String Transformations**: Case conversion, trimming, padding, substring extraction, pattern replacement.\n\n**Numeric Transformations**: Arithmetic operations, rounding, scaling, unit conversion.\n\n**Temporal Transformations**: Date/time parsing, formatting, timezone conversion.\n\n**Lookup Transformations**: Value substitution based on lookup tables.\n\n### Stage 3: Data Enrichment\n\nData enrichment augments records with information from external sources including reference databases, external APIs, and cache layers.\n\nWhen an enrichment source is unavailable, the engine applies configured behaviors: FAIL (route to error handling), SKIP (leave empty), DEFAULT (apply defaults), or STALE (use expired cache).\n\n### Stage 4: Quality Scoring\n\nQuality scoring evaluates transformed records and assigns a score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on completeness, consistency, conformance, and timeliness.\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Beta defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### TransformationRequest\n\nRepresents a batch received from Module Alpha:\n\n```\nTransformationRequest:\n  request_id: string            # UUID v4 generated by Module Alpha\n  batch_id: string              # Links to source batch\n  records: list<ValidatedRecord>\n  priority: enum                # NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL\n  transformation_profile: string\n```\n\n### IntermediateRecord\n\nRepresents a record during transformation processing:\n\n```\nIntermediateRecord:\n  record_id: string\n  original_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  current_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  stage: enum                   # MAPPING, TRANSFORM, ENRICHMENT, SCORING\n  applied_rules: list<string>\n  transformation_log: list<TransformationLogEntry>\n```\n\n### TransformationLogEntry\n\nCaptures details of a single transformation operation:\n\n```\nTransformationLogEntry:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  rule_id: string\n  field_name: string\n  previous_value: FieldValue\n  new_value: FieldValue\n  operation: string\n```\n\n### TransformedRecord\n\nRepresents a fully transformed record ready for Module Gamma:\n\n```\nTransformedRecord:\n  record_id: string\n  fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  quality_score: float          # 0.0 to 1.0\n  quality_dimensions: QualityDimensions\n  transformation_timestamp: datetime\n  rules_applied: integer\n  lineage_id: string\n```\n\n### QualityDimensions\n\nBreakdown of quality score components:\n\n```\nQualityDimensions:\n  completeness_score: float\n  consistency_score: float\n  conformance_score: float\n  timeliness_score: float\n  overall_score: float\n```\n\n### TransformationFailure\n\nCaptures information about failed records:\n\n```\nTransformationFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  failure_stage: enum\n  failure_rule: string\n  error_code: string\n  error_message: string\n  field_name: string\n  is_recoverable: boolean\n```\n\n---\n\n## Transformation

or identification.\n\n**Configuration**: `hash_rules` (list with target, source_fields, algorithm)\n\n```\nhash_rules: [{target: \"record_hash\", source_fields: [\"id\", \"date\"], algorithm: \"SHA256\"}]\n```\n\n#### Rule 17: Sequence Generation\n\nGenerates sequential identifiers for records.\n\n**Configuration**: `sequences` (map with prefix, start, padding, scope)\n\n```\nsequences: {\"batch_seq\": {prefix: \"ORD\", padding: 8, scope: \"BATCH\"}}\n```\n\n### Rule Evaluation Order\n\n1.

Generation Rules (Hash, Sequence)\n10. Quality Rules (Scoring)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nModule Beta implements comprehensive error handling following the fail-forward principle: isolate failures, capture context, and continue processing valid records while routing failed records to appropriate error channels.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### Mapping Errors\n\nOccur when schema mapping operations fail due to incompatible structures or missing required fields.\n\n**Common Causes**: Missing required source fields, type incompatibility between source and target, invalid mapping configuration, circular field references\n\n**Handling**: Create MappingFailure record with source field state, target schema requirements, and specific mapping rule that failed. Route to mapping error queue. If mapping failure rate exceeds `MAPPING_ERROR_THRESHOLD`, suspend processing and alert operators.\n\n**MappingFailure Structure**:\n```\nMappingFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  source_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  failed_mapping: string\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"MAP_001_MISSING_REQUIRED\"\n  error_message: string\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `beta_mapping_errors_total`, `beta_mapping_error_rate`, `beta_mapping_errors_by_schema`\n\n#### Transformation Errors\n\nOccur when field transformation operations produce invalid results or encounter unexpected input.\n\n**Common Causes**: Regex pattern failures, numeric overflow/underflow, date parsing failures, lookup table misses with FAIL policy, invalid encoding sequences\n\n**Handling**: Log transformation context including input value, rule configuration, and intermediate state. Apply configured fallback:\n- **FAIL**: Route entire record to error queue\n- **SKIP**: Leave field unchanged and continue\n- **DEFAULT**: Apply default value and continue\n- **NULL**: Set field to null and continue\n\n**TransformationError Structure**:\n```\nTransformationError:\n  record_id: string\n  rule_id: string\n  field_name: string\n  input_value: string\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"TRX_003_PATTERN_MISMATCH\"\n  error_message: string\n  intermediate_state: map<string, FieldValue>\n```\n\n**Configuration**: `TRANSFORM_ERROR_POLICY`, `TRANSFORM_MAX_RETRIES`, `TRANSFORM_TIMEOUT_MS`\n\n#### Enrichment Errors\n\nOccur when external data sources are unavailable or return unexpected results.\n\n**Common Causes**: Network connectivity issues, authentication failures, rate limiting, source timeout, malformed response data, lookup key not found\n\n**Transient Errors** (network, timeout): Retry with exponential backoff up to `ENRICHMENT_MAX_RETRIES`. If retries exhausted, apply configured fallback.\n\n**Permanent Errors** (not found, invalid key): Apply fallback immediately without retry.\n\n**Source Degradation**: Track error rates per enrichment source. When error rate exceeds `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD`, open circuit breaker for that source.\n\n**EnrichmentError Structure**:\n```\nEnrichmentError:\n  record_id: string\n  enrichment_source: string\n  lookup_key: string\n  error_category: enum          # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ENR_002_SOURCE_TIMEOUT\"\n  retry_count: integer\n  circuit_state: enum           # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Configuration**: `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD`, `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_TIMEOUT_MS`\n\n#### Quality Score Errors\n\nOccur when quality scoring cannot complete or produces invalid results.\n\n**Handling**: Quality scoring errors are generally non-fatal. Records receive a quality score of 0.0 with flags indicating scoring failure. Processing continues to Module Gamma.\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Errors\n\nOccur when system resources are depleted during transformation processing.\n\n**Common Causes**: Memory pressure from large records, thread pool saturation, connection pool depletion\n\n**Handling**: Resource exhaustion triggers graceful degradation:\n1. Pause acceptance of new batches from Module Alpha\n2. Complete in-flight transformations\n3. Clear transformation caches\n4. Signal unhealthy status\n5. Resume when resources recover\n\n### Error Queue Management\n\nFailed records route to categorized error queues:\n- `beta_mapping_errors`: Schema mapping failures\n- `beta_transform_errors`: Field transformation failures\n- `beta_enrichment_errors`: Enrichment operation failures\n- `beta_critical_errors`: Unrecoverable errors\n\n**Queue Operations**: Inspection (query failures), Correction (update and mark for reprocessing), Replay (reinject corrected records), Expiration (auto-purge after retention)\n\n**Configuration**: `ERROR_QUEUE_CAPACITY`, `ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS`\n\n### Error Logging\n\nAll errors generate structured log entries:\n\n```\nTransformationErrorLog:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  level: enum                   # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL\n  error_category: string\n  error_code: string\n  message: string\n  record_id: string\n  batch_id: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `beta_errors_total`, `beta_retries_total`, `beta_circuit_breaker_trips`\n\n**Gauges**: `beta_error_queue_size`, `beta_circuit_breaker_state`, `beta_degradation_mode`\n\n**Histograms**: `beta_error_recovery_duration`, `beta_retry_delay_seconds`\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n**Mapping Recovery**: Log failure → route to queue → increment counters → continue → alert if threshold exceeded\n\n**Transformation Recovery**: Capture state → apply fallback → log outcome → continue or route\n\n**Enrichment Recovery**: Detect type → retry if transient → apply fallback → update circuit → continue\n\n**Resource Recovery**: Detect pressure → pause intake → drain queues → clear caches → wait → resume\n\n### Error Escalation\n\nWhen error rates exceed configured thresholds, the system escalates through multiple levels:\n\n**Level 1 - Warning**: Log elevated error rates, emit alert metrics\n**Level 2 - Throttle**: Reduce intake rate from Module Alpha\n**Level 3 - Circuit Break**: Open circuit breakers for failing enrichment sources\n**Level 4 - Halt**: Suspend all processing pending operator intervention\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nModule Beta behavior is controlled through configuration parameters.\n\n### Pipeline Configuration\n\n#### TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 8 | **Range**: 1-64\n\nNumber of concurrent transformation threads.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_BATCH_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 500 | **Range**: 1-10000\n\nRecords processed per transformation batch.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 30000 | **Range**: 1000-300000\n\nMaximum time allowed for transforming a single record.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_QUEUE_CAPACITY\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5000 | **Range**: 100-100000\n\nMaximum records queued for transformation.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_PROFILE_DEFAULT\n\n**Type**: String | **Default**: \"standard\"\n\nNamed transformation profile applied when none specified.\n\n### Enrichment Configuration\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 3600 | **Range**: 60-86400\n\nTime-to-live in seconds for cached enrichment results.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_CACHE_MAX_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 100000 | **Range**: 1000-10000000\n\nMaximum entries in the enrichment cache.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5000 | **Range**: 100-60000\n\nTimeout for individual enrichment operations.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_MAX_RETRIES\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 3 | **Range**: 0-10\n\nMaximum retry attempts for transient enrichment failures.\n\n### Quality Configuration\n\n#### QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 0.7 | **Range**: 0.0-1.0\n\nQuality score below which a warning is logged.\n\n#### QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 0.3 | **Range**: 0.0-1.0\n\nQuality score below which the record is flagged as low quality.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Points\n\nModule Beta integrates with other Data Pipeline System components through well-defined interfaces.\n\n### Module Alpha Integration\n\nModule Beta receives validated records from Module Alpha through the standardized handoff protocol.\n\n**Handoff Reception**: Beta exposes an endpoint for receiving `TransformationRequest` batches. Upon receipt, Beta validates batch integrity, acknowledges receipt, and queues records for transformation.\n\n**Request Validation**: Verify batch checksum, confirm metadata, validate record count, check transformation profile exists.\n\n**Back-Pressure**: When queues approach capacity, Beta signals back-pressure through the integration layer, causing Alpha to pause delivery. See `integration-layer.md` for protocol details.\n\n### Module Gamma Integration\n\nModule Beta delivers transformed records to Module Gamma for output processing.\n\n**Handoff Payload**:\n```\nTransformationResponse:\n  batch_id: string\n  records: list<TransformedRecord>\n  transformation_summary: TransformationSummary\n  quality_summary: QualitySummary\n  checksum: string\n```\n\nFor complete handoff specifications, see `integration-layer.md`.\n\n### Enrichment Source Integration\n\nModule Beta connects to external enrichment sources:\n\n**Database Sources**: JDBC connections with pooling, health checking.\n\n**API Sources**: HTTP/HTTPS with authentication, rate limiting.\n\n**Cache Integration**: Distributed cache systems for enrichment caching.\n\n### Health Check Integration\n\nBeta exposes health status including component states, queue depths, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\n**Health Levels**: HEALTHY (normal), DEGRADED (reduced capacity), UNHEALTHY (processing halted)\n\n### Monitoring Integration\n\nBeta emits metrics for throughput, latency, quality, errors, and resources. Structured logs follow pipeline format.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\nModule Beta implements compliance controls for audit, regulatory, and security requirements.\n\n### Audit Logging\n\nAll transformation operations are logged:\n\n**Record-Level Audit**: Original state, all transformations with before/after values, quality scores, final state.\n\n**Rule-Level Audit**: Rule identifier, input/output values, execution timing.\n\nAudit requirements specified in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 3.\n\n### Data Lineage\n\nModule Beta maintains transformation lineage:\n\n**Lineage Capture**: Source record ID, transformation session, rule sequence, enrichment references, output record ID.\n\n**Lineage Query**: Forward tracing (input to outputs) and backward tracing (output to inputs).\n\nLineage requirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 4.\n\n### Data Protection\n\n**Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted during transformation.\n\n**Tokenization**: PII fields can be replaced with tokens.\n\n**Masking**: Fields can be partially masked for logging.\n\nRequirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 7.\n\n### Security Controls\n\n**Enrichment Source Authentication**: All external connections use appropriate authentication.\n\n**Transport Encryption**: Inter-module communication uses TLS.\n\n**Input Sanitization**: Transformation inputs are sanitized.\n\nRequirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 6.\n\n---\n\n*This document is the authoritative specification for Module Beta.

Examples: persistent connectivity loss, resource exhaustion, data corruption. Critical errors trigger alerts and may halt processing.\n\n**ERROR**: Failures preventing processing of specific records or batches without systemic failure. Examples: validation failures, transformation errors, delivery rejections.\n\n**WARNING**: Conditions that may indicate problems but do not prevent processing. Examples: elevated retry rates, degraded enrichment sources.\n\n#### Recoverability Classification\n\n**TRANSIENT**: May resolve through retry. Examples: network timeouts, temporary service unavailability, rate limiting. The Integration Layer applies retry logic with exponential backoff.\n\n**PERMANENT**: Will not resolve through retry. Examples: schema violations, invalid data formats, authorization failures. Bypass retry logic and proceed to error handling.\n\n#### Scope Classification\n\n**RECORD-LEVEL**: Affects individual records. Other records proceed normally.\n**BATCH-LEVEL**: Affects entire batches. All records in batch impacted.\n**MODULE-LEVEL**: Affects entire module operation.\n**PIPELINE-LEVEL**: Affects entire pipeline. All data flow halts.\n\n### Error Message Structure\n\n```\nIntegrationError:\n  error_id: string              # UUID v4 uniquely identifying this error\n  correlation_id: string        # Links to originating message/batch\n  timestamp: datetime           # When error was detected\n  source_module: enum           # ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA\n  severity: enum                # CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING\n  recoverability: enum          # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT, UNKNOWN\n  scope: enum                   # RECORD, BATCH, MODULE, PIPELINE\n  error_code: string            # Hierarchical code (e.g., \"INT_ALPHA_001\")\n  error_message: string         # Human-readable description\n  context: ErrorContext\n  retry_eligible: boolean\n```\n\n```\nErrorContext:\n  record_id: string             # Affected record (if record-level)\n  batch_id: string              # Affected batch (if batch-level)\n  field_name: string            # Affected field (if applicable)\n  expected_value: string\n  actual_value: string\n  upstream_errors: list<string> # Related upstream error IDs\n```\n\n### Module Alpha Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Alpha generates errors propagating through the Integration Layer. For complete specification, see `module-alpha.md` Section 5.\n\n**Connection Errors**: When source adapters cannot establish connectivity, Alpha generates MODULE-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer notifies downstream modules to expect reduced throughput.\n\n**Parse Errors**: When input parsing fails, Alpha generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. Failed records are excluded from batches with error details in batch metadata.\n\n**Validation Errors**: When records fail validation rules, Alpha generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer propagates summaries to Module Beta through `validation_summary`.\n\n**Buffer Overflow**: When Alpha's buffer reaches capacity without acknowledgment, Alpha generates MODULE-LEVEL errors triggering back-pressure protocols.\n\n### Module Beta Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Beta generates errors during transformation requiring Integration Layer coordination. For complete specification, see `module-beta.md` Section 5.\n\n**Mapping Errors**: When schema mapping fails, Beta generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer ensures failed records are excluded from downstream batches.\n\n**Transformation Errors**: When field transformations produce invalid results, Beta generates RECORD-LEVEL errors preserved in the transformation audit trail.\n\n**Enrichment Errors**: When external enrichment sources are unavailable, Beta generates errors with severity per configuration. The Integration Layer coordinates circuit breaker state.\n\n**Quality Score Failures**: When records fall below thresholds, Beta generates WARNING-level errors. The Integration Layer tracks quality degradation trends.\n\n### Module Gamma Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Gamma generates errors during output processing completing the error propagation chain. For complete specification, see `module-gamma.md` Section 6.\n\n**Rendering Errors**: When format rendering fails, Gamma generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer ensures failures are tracked against source records.\n\n**Routing Errors**: When no valid destination can be determined, Gamma generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer may trigger re-evaluation of upstream rules.\n\n**Delivery Errors**: When destination delivery fails, Gamma generates errors with severity based on retry status. The Integration Layer coordinates retry timing and circuit breaker state.\n\n**Acknowledgment Errors**: When acknowledgments timeout or fail, Gamma generates WARNING or ERROR level issues. The Integration Layer ensures ambiguous states are tracked for reconciliation.\n\n### Cross-Module Error Propagation\n\n#### Downstream Propagation\n\n```\nBatchErrorSummary:\n  upstream_errors: integer\n  error_breakdown: map<string, integer>\n  affected_record_ids: list<string>\n```\n\nDownstream modules use this to skip failed records and adjust expectations.\n\n#### Upstream Propagation\n\n```\nErrorNotification:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  errors: list<IntegrationError>\n  action_required: enum         # NONE, THROTTLE, HALT, INVESTIGATE\n```\n\nUpstream modules use this to adjust production rates and trigger alerts.\n\n### Circuit Breaker Coordination\n\n```\nCircuitBreakerState:\n  circuit_id: string\n  state: enum                   # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n  failure_count: integer\n  last_failure: datetime\n  next_attempt: datetime\n```\n\n**CLOSED**: Normal operation. Failures increment counter.\n**OPEN**: Requests immediately rejected. Timer until half-open.\n**HALF_OPEN**: Single test request allowed.\n\n```\nCircuitStateChange:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  circuit_id: string\n  previous_state: enum\n  new_state: enum\n  affected_modules: list<enum>\n```\n\n### Error Recovery Procedures\n\n**Transient Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff. After exhaustion, reclassify as permanent.\n\n**Validation Failures**: No retry. Route to error queue with diagnostic context.\n\n**Resource Exhaustion**: Trigger back-pressure. Clear caches. Resume gradually.\n\n**Module Unavailability**: Open circuit breaker. Queue pending work. Alert operators.\n\n**Data Corruption**: Halt affected processing. Generate CRITICAL alert. Require intervention.\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `integration_errors_total`, `integration_retries_total`, `integration_circuit_breaker_trips_total`\n\n**Gauges**: `integration_error_queue_depth`, `integration_circuit_breaker_state`\n\n**Histograms**: `integration_error_recovery_duration_seconds`\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Integration Layer provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for operational visibility.\n\n### Health Check Protocol\n\n```\nHealthCheckRequest:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  check_type: enum              # LIVENESS, READINESS, DETAILED\n```\n\n```\nHealthCheckResponse:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  status: enum                  # HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY\n  checks: list<ComponentHealth>\n  uptime_seconds: integer\n```\n\n```\nComponentHealth:\n  component_name: string\n  status: enum\n  message: string\n  last_check: datetime\n```\n\n### Pipeline Health Status\n\n```\nPipelineHealthStatus:\n  overall_status: enum          # HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY\n  module_statuses: map<enum, ModuleHealth>\n  active_circuits_open: integer\n  error_rate_1m: float\n  throughput_records_per_second: float\n```\n\nStatus determination:\n- **HEALTHY**: All modules healthy, no circuits open, error rate below threshold\n- **DEGRADED**: Any module degraded OR any circuit open OR elevated error rate\n- **UNHEALTHY**: Any module unhealthy OR multiple circuits open\n\n### Throughput Metrics\n\n- `alpha_beta_batches_transferred_total`\n- `alpha_beta_records_transferred_total`\n- `beta_gamma_batches_transferred_total`\n- `beta_gamma_records_transferred_total`\n- `transfer_latency_seconds` (histogram)\n\n### Queue Depth Monitoring\n\n- `alpha_output_buffer_depth`\n- `beta_input_queue_depth`\n- `beta_output_buffer_depth`\n- `gamma_input_queue_depth`\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Alpha-to-Beta Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `ALPHA_BETA_BATCH_SIZE` | 1000 | Records per transfer batch |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000 | Max wait before flush |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30000 | Acknowledgment deadline |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | 1000 | Initial retry delay |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_MAX_RETRIES` | 5 | Maximum retry attempts |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER` | 2.0 | Retry backoff factor |\n\n### Beta-to-Gamma Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `BETA_GAMMA_BATCH_SIZE` | 500 | Records per transfer batch |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000 | Max wait before flush |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30000 | Acknowledgment deadline |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | 1000 | Initial retry delay |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_MAX_RETRIES` | 5 | Maximum retry attempts |\n\n### Back-Pressure Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `BACKPRESSURE_HIGH_WATERMARK` | 0.8 | Queue depth to activate |\n| `BACKPRESSURE_LOW_WATERMARK` | 0.5 | Queue depth to deactivate |\n\n### Circuit Breaker Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | 5 | Failures to open circuit |\n| `CIRCUIT_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS` | 60000 | Duration before half-open |\n\n### Health Check Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | 10000 | Check frequency |\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000 | Check deadline |\n\n---\n\n## Document References\n\n| Document | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `data-pipeline-overview.md` | System architecture and overview |\n| `module-alpha.md` | Data ingestion module specification |\n| `module-beta.md` | Data transformation module specification |\n| `module-gamma.md` | Data output module specification |\n| `compliance-requirements.md` | Audit, security, and regulatory requirements |\n\n---\n\n*This document is the authoritative specification for the Integration Layer.

As the entry point for all data entering the pipeline, Module Alpha implements robust connectivity, parsing, validation, and buffering capabilities.\n    22→\n    23→### Core Responsibilities\n    24→\n    25→**Source Connectivity**: Establishing and maintaining connections to external data sources including REST APIs, relational databases, message queues, and file systems. The connectivity layer abstracts protocol-specific details behind a uniform interface.\n    26→\n    27→**Input Parsing**: Converting raw data from native source formats into the pipeline's internal record representation. The parsing engine handles character encoding variations, escape sequences, and format-specific syntax while preserving data fidelity.\n    28→\n    29→**Validation Engine**: Applying configurable validation rules to incoming records before they proceed to transformation. Validation encompasses type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity, and custom business rules.\n    30→\n    31→**Flow Control**: Managing throughput variations between high-velocity sources and downstream processing capacity through internal buffering, back-pressure signaling, and adaptive rate limiting.\n    32→\n    33→### Processing Model\n    34→\n    35→Module Alpha processes data through a staged pipeline:\n    36→\n    37→```\n    38→┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n    39→│                     MODULE ALPHA PIPELINE                        │\n    40→├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n    41→│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n    42→│  │    Source    │    │    Input     │    │  Validation  │      │\n    43→│  │   Adapter    │───▶│   Parser     │───▶│   Engine     │      │\n    44→│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘      │\n    45→│         │                   │                   │               │\n    46→│         ▼                   ▼                   ▼               │\n    47→│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n    48→│  │  Connection  │    │    Parse     │    │  Validation  │      │\n    49→│  │    Pool      │    │    Errors    │    │   Failures   │      │\n    50→│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────┬────────┘      │\n    51→│                                                 │               │\n    52→│                                          ┌──────▼──────┐       │\n    53→│                                          │   Output    │───────┼──▶ To Beta\n    54→│                                          │   Buffer    │       │\n    55→│                                          └─────────────┘       │\n    56→└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n    57→```\n    58→\n    59→### Design Principles\n    60→\n    61→**Fail-Forward Processing**: Individual record failures do not halt the pipeline. Failed records are captured with diagnostic context and routed to error handling while processing continues.\n    62→\n    63→**Source Agnosticism**: The core pipeline logic remains independent of source-specific protocols. Source adapters encapsulate all protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n    64→\n    65→**Defensive Parsing**: The parser assumes hostile or malformed input and validates all data before processing. Buffer overflows, injection attacks, and format corruption are handled gracefully.\n    66→\n    67→**Observable Operations**: All processing stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis.\n    68→\n    69→---\n    70→\n    71→## Input Sources\n    72→\n    73→Module Alpha supports data acquisition from multiple source types through dedicated source adapters.\n    74→\n    75→### REST API Sources\n    76→\n    77→REST API sources retrieve data through HTTP/HTTPS requests.

to source\n   113→  - disconnect(): Release connection resources\n   114→  - fetch(batch_size): Retrieve next batch of raw records\n   115→  - acknowledge(record_ids): Confirm successful processing\n   116→  - get_metrics(): Return adapter-specific metrics\n   117→  - health_check(): Verify source availability\n   118→```\n   119→\n   120→---\n   121→\n   122→## Data Structures\n   123→\n

As the entry point for all data entering the pipeline, Module Alpha implements robust connectivity, parsing, validation, and buffering capabilities.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Source Connectivity**: Establishing and maintaining connections to external data sources including REST APIs, relational databases, message queues, and file systems. The connectivity layer abstracts protocol-specific details behind a uniform interface.\n\n**Input Parsing**: Converting raw data from native source formats into the pipeline's internal record representation. The parsing engine handles character encoding variations, escape sequences, and format-specific syntax while preserving data fidelity.\n\n**Validation Engine**: Applying configurable validation rules to incoming records before they proceed to transformation. Validation encompasses type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity, and custom business rules.\n\n**Flow Control**: Managing throughput variations between high-velocity sources and downstream processing capacity through internal buffering, back-pressure signaling, and adaptive rate limiting.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Alpha processes data through a staged pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     MODULE ALPHA PIPELINE                        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n│  │    Source    │    │    Input     │    │  Validation  │      │\n│  │   Adapter    │───▶│   Parser     │───▶│   Engine     │      │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘      │\n│         │                   │                   │               │\n│         ▼                   ▼                   ▼               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n│  │  Connection  │    │    Parse     │    │  Validation  │      │\n│  │    Pool      │    │    Errors    │    │   Failures   │      │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────┬────────┘      │\n│                                                 │               │\n│                                          ┌──────▼──────┐       │\n│                                          │   Output    │───────┼──▶ To Beta\n│                                          │   Buffer    │       │\n│                                          └─────────────┘       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**Fail-Forward Processing**: Individual record failures do not halt the pipeline. Failed records are captured with diagnostic context and routed to error handling while processing continues.\n\n**Source Agnosticism**: The core pipeline logic remains independent of source-specific protocols. Source adapters encapsulate all protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n\n**Defensive Parsing**: The parser assumes hostile or malformed input and validates all data before processing. Buffer overflows, injection attacks, and format corruption are handled gracefully.\n\n**Observable Operations**: All processing stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Input Sources\n\nModule Alpha supports data acquisition from multiple source types through dedicated source adapters.\n\n### REST API Sources\n\nREST API sources retrieve data through HTTP/HTTPS requests.

The system is designed to handle batch and near-real-time processing workloads with configurable throughput characteristics.\n    21→\n    22→### Business Context\n    23→\n    24→Modern enterprises generate and consume vast quantities of data from disparate sources including transactional databases, event streams, third-party APIs, and file-based exports. The Data Pipeline System addresses the fundamental challenge of consolidating, normalizing, and distributing this data in a consistent, reliable manner.\n    25→\n    26→The system serves several critical business functions:\n    27→\n    28→**Data Consolidation**: Multiple upstream data sources are ingested through a unified interface, eliminating the need for point-to-point integrations between source systems and downstream consumers. This consolidation reduces integration complexity and provides a single point of data governance.\n    29→\n    30→**Data Quality Assurance**: Raw data from external sources frequently contains inconsistencies, missing values, and format variations. The pipeline applies comprehensive validation and transformation rules to ensure output data meets established quality standards before delivery to consumers.\n    31→\n    32→**Operational Efficiency**: By centralizing data processing logic in a purpose-built pipeline system, organizations avoid duplicating transformation code across multiple applications. Changes to data formats or business rules can be implemented once in the pipeline rather than propagated across numerous downstream systems.\n    33→\n    34→**Audit and Compliance**: Financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries require comprehensive audit trails for data movement and transformation. The Data Pipeline System provides built-in logging and traceability capabilities to support compliance requirements. For detailed compliance specifications, see `compliance-requirements.md`.\n    35→\n    36→### Technical Objectives\n    37→\n    38→The Data Pipeline System achieves its business objectives through the following technical capabilities:\n    39→\n    40→**High Throughput Processing**: The system is designed to process millions of records per hour through parallel processing and efficient memory utilization. Configurable batch sizes and worker pool settings allow operators to tune performance characteristics for specific deployment environments.\n    41→\n    42→**Fault Tolerance**: Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. The system isolates failures, routes problematic records to dead letter queues for later analysis, and continues processing valid data. Comprehensive error classification enables targeted remediation.\n    43→\n    44→**Extensibility**: New data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations can be added through well-defined interfaces without modifying core pipeline logic. The modular architecture supports incremental capability expansion.\n    45→\n    46→**Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and health check endpoints provide operators with real-time visibility into pipeline status, throughput, and error rates. Integration with standard monitoring platforms enables proactive alerting and capacity planning.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## Architecture Overview\n    51→\n    52→The Data Pipeline System follows a three-stage processing model where data flows sequentially through ingestion, transformation, and output modules. Each module is independently deployable and communicates with adjacent modules through well-defined message protocols.\n    53→\n    54→### System Architecture Diagram\n    55→\n    56→```\n

127→```\n   128→\n   129→### Module Boundaries\n   130→\n   131→Each module in the Data Pipeline System operates as a distinct processing unit with clearly defined responsibilities:\n   132→\n   133→**Module Alpha** handles all data ingestion concerns including source connectivity, input parsing, initial validation, and buffering. Alpha's primary responsibility is accepting raw data from external sources and converting it into the pipeline's internal record format. See `module-alpha.md` for the complete ingestion specification.\n   134→\n   135→**Module Beta** performs all data transformation operations including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment from reference sources, and quality scoring. Beta receives validated records from Alpha and produces enriched, normalized records ready for output. See `module-beta.md` for the complete transformation specification.\n   136→\n   137→**Module Gamma** manages all output concerns including format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management. Gamma receives transformed records from Beta and ensures reliable delivery to downstream consumers. See `module-gamma.md` for the complete output specification.\n   138→\n   139→### Inter-Module Communication\n   140→\n   141→Modules communicate through a standardized message protocol that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data integrity and traceability. The integration layer defines message formats, handoff procedures, and error propagation patterns. See `integration-layer.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n   142→\n   143→---\n   144→\n   145→## Module Summary\n   146→\n   147→This section provides a high-level overview of each module's responsibilities and key capabilities. For detailed specifications, consult the individual module documentation.\n   148→\n   149→### Module Alpha: Data Ingestion\n   150→\n   151→Module Alpha serves as the entry point for all data entering the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n   152→\n   153→**Source Connectivity**: Alpha supports multiple input source types including REST APIs, relational databases via JDBC, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file-based inputs (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet). Source adapters implement a common interface that abstracts connection management, authentication, and data retrieval.\n   154→\n   155→**Input Parsing**: Raw data from external sources is parsed into the pipeline's internal record format. The parsing engine handles various encodings, escape sequences, and format variations. Malformed inputs are captured with contextual error information for later analysis.\n   156→\n   157→**Validation Engine**: Alpha applies configurable validation rules to incoming records. Validations include type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity checks, and custom business rules. Records failing validation are routed to error handling with detailed failure descriptions.\n   158→\n   159→**Buffering and Flow Control**: To manage throughput variations between sources and downstream processing, Alpha maintains internal buffers with configurable size limits. Back-pressure mechanisms prevent memory exhaustion when downstream modules cannot keep pace with ingestion rates.\n   160→\n   161→Key configuration parameters include `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VALIDATION_STRICT_MODE`, and `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK`. See `module-alpha.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   162→\n   163→### Module Beta: Data Transformation\n   164→\n   165→Module Beta transforms ingested records into the format required by downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n   166→\n   167→**Schema Mapping**: Beta maps fields from the internal record format to target schemas. Mapping rules support field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic. Multiple output schemas can be active simultaneously.\n   168→\n   169→**Field Transformation**: Individual fields undergo transformation operations including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformation rules are evaluated in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent rules.\n   170→\n   171→**Data Enrichment**: Records can be enriched with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. Enrichment operations support caching to minimize repeated lookups for frequently referenced values.\n   172→\n   173→**Quality Scoring**: Each record receives a quality score based on completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns. Scores enable downstream consumers to make informed decisions about data reliability. Configurable thresholds trigger warnings or errors for low-quality records.\n   174→\n   175→Key configuration parameters include `TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM`, `ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR`, and `MAX_TRANSFORM_TIME_MS`. See `module-beta.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   176→\n   177→### Module Gamma: Data Output\n   178→\n   179→Module Gamma delivers transformed records to downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n   180→\n   181→**Format Rendering**: Records are rendered into output formats appropriate for each destination. Supported formats include JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom formats defined via templates. Rendering handles character encoding, escaping, and structural requirements.\n   182→\n   183→**Delivery Routing**: Records are routed to appropriate destinations based on content, quality scores, or configuration rules. Routing supports fan-out patterns where a single record is delivered to multiple destinations, as well as conditional routing based on record attributes.\n   184→\n   185→**Acknowledgment Handling**: Gamma tracks delivery status and processes acknowledgments from destinations. Successful deliveries update tracking records; failures trigger retry logic according to configured policies. Persistent failures route records to the dead letter queue.\n   186→\n   187→**Dead Letter Queue**: Records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts are written to a dead letter queue with comprehensive diagnostic information. Operators can inspect, correct, and replay failed records through administrative interfaces.\n   188→\n   189→Key configuration parameters include `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. See `module-gamma.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   190→\n   191→---\n   192→\n   193→## Data Flow\n   194→\n   195→Data moves through the pipeline in a sequential, stage-gated process. This section describes the end-to-end flow from source ingestion through final delivery.\n   196→\n   197→### Stage 1: Source Acquisition\n   198→\n   199→The pipeline execution begins when Module Alpha initiates data retrieval from configured sources. Source adapters establish connections, authenticate as necessary, and begin extracting data according to their specific protocols.\n   200→\n   201→For pull-based sources (databases, APIs), Alpha issues queries or requests according to configured schedules or triggers. For push-based sources (message queues, file drops), Alpha monitors inbound channels and processes data as it arrives.\n   202→\n   203→Raw data is captured in its native format and passed to the parsing engine. Source metadata including origin identifier, extraction timestamp, and batch sequence number is attached to each data unit.\n   204→\n   205→### Stage 2: Parsing and Initial Validation\n   206→\n   207→The parsing engine converts raw data into the pipeline's internal record format. Each source type has an associated parser that understands the source's data structure and extracts individual records.\n   208→\n   209→Parsing failures generate detailed error records capturing the malformed input, error location, and failure reason. Failed parses are logged and routed to error handling; they do not halt processing of valid records.\n   210→\n   211→Successfully parsed records undergo initial validation in Module Alpha. Validation rules check basic data integrity including required field presence, type conformance, and format validity. Records passing validation proceed to the buffering queue.\n   212→\n   213→### Stage 3: Module Handoff (Alpha to Beta)\n   214→\n   215→When the Alpha output buffer reaches the configured batch threshold or a flush timeout expires, accumulated records are packaged into a transfer batch. The batch includes metadata identifying the source batch, record count, and checksum.\n   216→\n   217→The integration layer mediates the handoff between Alpha and Beta. It validates batch integrity, manages flow control when Beta is processing slowly, and handles retry logic if the initial handoff fails. See `integration-layer.md` for handoff protocol details.\n   218→\n   219→Beta acknowledges batch receipt, at which point Alpha can release buffer space and proceed with additional ingestion. If acknowledgment is not received within the configured timeout, Alpha initiates retry procedures.\n   220→\n   221→### Stage 4: Transformation Processing\n   222→\n   223→Module Beta processes each record through its transformation pipeline. The transformation stages execute in sequence:\n   224→\n   225→**Schema Mapping** applies field mapping rules to convert records from the internal format to target schemas. Records may be mapped to multiple output schemas simultaneously.\n   226→\n   227→**Field Transformation** applies transformation rules to individual fields. Transformations execute in priority order, with each transformation potentially depending on results from earlier transformations.\n   228→\n   229→**Data Enrichment** augments records with data from external reference sources. The enrichment engine manages cache lookups, external service calls, and timeout handling.\n   230→\n   231→**Quality Scoring** evaluates each record against quality criteria and assigns a numeric score. Records below configured thresholds may be flagged, logged, or rejected depending on configuration.\n   232→\n   233→### Stage 5: Module Handoff (Beta to Gamma)\n   234→\n   235→Transformed records are batched for handoff to Module Gamma following the same batch protocol used between Alpha and Beta. The integration layer ensures reliable transfer with acknowledgment and retry support.\n   236→\n   237→Batch metadata is extended to include transformation summary statistics: record count, average quality score, error count, and enrichment hit rate. This metadata supports operational monitoring.\n   238→\n   239→### Stage 6: Output Rendering and Delivery\n   240→\n   241→Module Gamma receives transformed batches and routes individual records to their designated destinations. For each record:\n   242→\n   243→**Destination Determination** evaluates routing rules to identify target destinations. A record may have one or multiple destinations.\n   244→\n   245→**Format Rendering** converts the record to the format required by each destination. Rendering is performed independently for each destination, allowing different formats for the same record.\n   246→\n   247→**Delivery Execution** transmits the rendered record to the destination. The delivery engine manages connection pooling, authentication, and transmission protocols specific to each destination type.\n   248→\n   249→**Acknowledgment Processing** waits for confirmation of successful delivery. Confirmed records update completion tracking; failed records enter retry queues.\n   250→\n   251→### Stage 7: Completion and Reconciliation\n   252→\n   253→When all records in a batch have been delivered (or routed to dead letter queue after retry exhaustion), Gamma reports batch completion to upstream modules. Completion reports include delivery statistics: success count, retry count, DLQ count, and timing metrics.\n   254→\n   255→The pipeline maintains end-to-end tracking that enables reconciliation between ingested and delivered records. Discrepancies trigger alerts for operator investigation.\n   256→\n   257→---\n   258→\n   259→## Cross-Cutting Concerns\n   260→\n   261→Several concerns span multiple modules and require coordinated implementation. This section describes these cross-cutting aspects and references their detailed specifications.\n   262→\n   263→### Error Handling Philosophy\n   264→\n   265→The Data Pipeline System follows a \"fail forward\" error handling philosophy. Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. Instead, failed records are isolated, logged with diagnostic information, and routed to appropriate error handling channels while processing continues for valid records.\n   266→\n   267→Error handling operates at multiple levels:\n   268→\n   269→**Record-Level Errors** affect individual records and are handled within the module where they occur. The record is marked as failed, diagnostic information is captured, and the record is routed to the module's error queue.\n   270→\n   271→**Batch-Level Errors** affect entire batches (e.g., network failures during handoff) and are handled by the integration layer's retry mechanisms.\n   272→\n   273→**Module-Level Errors** affect module operation (e.g., resource exhaustion) and may require operator intervention.\n   274→\n   275→Each module documents its specific error handling behaviors. For cross-module error propagation patterns, see `integration-layer.md`.\n   276→\n   277→### Logging and Observability\n   278→\n   279→All modules emit structured log entries following a common format that enables log aggregation and analysis. Log entries include:\n   280→\n   281→- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n   282→- Module identifier\n   283→- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)\n   284→- Correlation ID linking related entries\n   285→- Structured payload with context-specific fields\n   286→\n   287→Metrics are emitted via a standard metrics interface supporting integration with Prometheus, StatsD, and similar platforms. Standard metrics include throughput rates, latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.\n   288→\n   289→Health check endpoints expose module status for load balancer and orchestration platform integration. See `integration-layer.md` for health check specifications.\n   290→\n   291→### Compliance and Audit Requirements\n   292→\n   293→The pipeline supports compliance requirements through comprehensive audit logging and data lineage tracking. Audit events capture:\n   294→\n   295→- Data origin and ingestion timestamp\n   296→- All transformation operations applied\n   297→- Delivery confirmation with destination and timestamp\n   298→- User or system actions affecting pipeline configuration\n   299→\n   300→Audit logs are retained according to configurable policies and can be exported to external audit systems. Compliance requirements are detailed in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n   301→\n   302→### Security Considerations\n   303→\n   304→Security is implemented through multiple mechanisms:\n   305→\n   306→**Transport Security**: All inter-module communication uses TLS encryption. External connections support TLS with certificate validation.\n   307→\n   308→**Authentication**: Source and destination connections use appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, certificates, database credentials).\n   309→\n   310→**Authorization**: Pipeline operations are governed by role-based access control. Configuration changes require elevated privileges.\n   311→\n   312→**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption supports scenarios where certain fields must remain protected through the pipeline.\n   313→\n   314→Detailed security requirements are specified in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n   315→\n   316→---\n   317→\n   318→## Configuration Management\n   319→\n   320→Pipeline configuration follows a hierarchical model where default values can be overridden at increasingly specific levels.\n   321→\n   322→### Configuration Hierarchy\n   323→\n   324→1. **System Defaults**: Built-in defaults for all configuration parameters\n   325→2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)\n   326→3. **Module Configuration**: Module-specific parameter overrides\n   327→4. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Settings for specific sources or destinations\n   328→\n   329→Lower levels in the hierarchy override higher levels, allowing targeted configuration while maintaining sensible defaults.\n   330→\n   331→### Configuration Parameters\n   332→\n   333→Each module defines its configuration parameters in its detailed specification. Cross-module parameters defined in this overview include:\n   334→\n   335→| Parameter | Default | Description |\n   336→|-----------|---------|-------------|\n   337→| `PIPELINE_NAME` | `default` | Identifier for this pipeline instance |\n   338→| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum log level to emit |\n   339→| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether to emit metrics |\n   340→| `METRICS_PREFIX` | `datapipeline` | Prefix for metric names |\n   341→| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` | `8080` | Port for health check endpoint |\n   342→\n   343→### Configuration Updates\n   344→\n   345→Configuration changes can be applied without pipeline restart through the configuration reload mechanism. Modules detect configuration changes and apply them at safe points in processing.\n   346→\n   347→Some parameters require restart due to their nature (e.g., network ports, resource pool sizes). These are documented in module specifications.\n   348→\n   349→---\n   350→\n   351→## Deployment Considerations\n   352→\n   353→The Data Pipeline System supports various deployment models from single-node development environments to distributed production clusters.\n   354→\n   355→### Deployment Modes\n   356→\n   357→**Standalone Mode**: All modules run within a single process, suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. Inter-module communication uses in-memory queues.\n   358→\n   359→**Distributed Mode**: Each module runs as an independent service, communicating via network protocols. This mode supports horizontal scaling and fault isolation.\n   360→\n   361→**Hybrid Mode**: Selected modules are co-located while others run independently, balancing deployment complexity against scaling requirements.\n   362→\n   363→### Scaling Considerations\n   364→\n   365→**Module Alpha** scales based on source volume and variety. Multiple Alpha instances can partition source responsibility, or a single instance can handle multiple sources with connection pooling.\n   366→\n   367→**Module Beta** scales based on transformation complexity. Transformation is inherently parallelizable; adding Beta instances provides near-linear throughput improvement.\n   368→\n   369→**Module Gamma** scales based on destination count and delivery latency. Destinations with high latency may require dedicated Gamma instances to prevent bottlenecks.\n   370→\n   371→### High Availability\n   372→\n   373→Production deployments should include:\n   374→\n   375→- Multiple instances of each module for failover\n   376→- Health monitoring with automatic instance replacement\n   377→- Persistent queues between modules to prevent data loss during failures\n   378→- Geographic distribution for disaster recovery scenarios\n   379→\n   380→---\n   381→\n   382→## Document References\n   383→\n   384→This overview document provides architectural context for the Data Pipeline System.

[Deployment Considerations](#deployment-considerations)\n\n---\n\n## System Purpose\n\nThe Data Pipeline System provides a robust, scalable platform for processing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data from multiple external sources through a series of transformation stages, ultimately delivering formatted output to various downstream consumers. The system is designed to handle batch and near-real-time processing workloads with configurable throughput characteristics.\n\n### Business Context\n\nModern enterprises generate and consume vast quantities of data from disparate sources including transactional databases, event streams, third-party APIs, and file-based exports. The Data Pipeline System addresses the fundamental challenge of consolidating, normalizing, and distributing this data in a consistent, reliable manner.\n\nThe system serves several critical business functions:\n\n**Data Consolidation**: Multiple upstream data sources are ingested through a unified interface, eliminating the need for point-to-point integrations between source systems and downstream consumers. This consolidation reduces integration complexity and provides a single point of data governance.\n\n**Data Quality Assurance**: Raw data from external sources frequently contains inconsistencies, missing values, and format variations. The pipeline applies comprehensive validation and transformation rules to ensure output data meets established quality standards before delivery to consumers.\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: By centralizing data processing logic in a purpose-built pipeline system, organizations avoid duplicating transformation code across multiple applications. Changes to data formats or business rules can be implemented once in the pipeline rather than propagated across numerous downstream systems.\n\n**Audit and Compliance**: Financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries require comprehensive audit trails for data movement and transformation. The Data Pipeline System provides built-in logging and traceability capabilities to support compliance requirements. For detailed compliance specifications, see `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n### Technical Objectives\n\nThe Data Pipeline System achieves its business objectives through the following technical capabilities:\n\n**High Throughput Processing**: The system is designed to process millions of records per hour through parallel processing and efficient memory utilization. Configurable batch sizes and worker pool settings allow operators to tune performance characteristics for specific deployment environments.\n\n**Fault Tolerance**: Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. The system isolates failures, routes problematic records to dead letter queues for later analysis, and continues processing valid data. Comprehensive error classification enables targeted remediation.\n\n**Extensibility**: New data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations can be added through well-defined interfaces without modifying core pipeline logic. The modular architecture supports incremental capability expansion.\n\n**Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and health check endpoints provide operators with real-time visibility into pipeline status, throughput, and error rates. Integration with standard monitoring platforms enables proactive alerting and capacity planning.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe Data Pipeline System follows a three-stage processing model where data flows sequentially through ingestion, transformation, and output modules. Each module is independently deployable and communicates with adjacent modules through well-defined message protocols.\n\n### System Architecture

Alpha's primary responsibility is accepting raw data from external sources and converting it into the pipeline's internal record format. See `module-alpha.md` for the complete ingestion specification.\n\n**Module Beta** performs all data transformation operations including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment from reference sources, and quality scoring. Beta receives validated records from Alpha and produces enriched, normalized records ready for output. See `module-beta.md` for the complete transformation specification.\n\n**Module Gamma** manages all output concerns including format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management. Gamma receives transformed records from Beta and ensures reliable delivery to downstream consumers. See `module-gamma.md` for the complete output specification.\n\n### Inter-Module Communication\n\nModules communicate through a standardized message protocol that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data integrity and traceability. The integration layer defines message formats, handoff procedures, and error propagation patterns. See `integration-layer.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n\n---\n\n## Module Summary\n\nThis section provides a high-level overview of each module's responsibilities and key capabilities. For detailed specifications, consult the individual module documentation.\n\n### Module Alpha: Data Ingestion\n\nModule Alpha serves as the entry point for all data entering the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Source Connectivity**: Alpha supports multiple input source types including REST APIs, relational databases via JDBC, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file-based inputs (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet). Source adapters implement a common interface that abstracts connection management, authentication, and data retrieval.\n\n**Input Parsing**: Raw data from external sources is parsed into the pipeline's internal record format. The parsing engine handles various encodings, escape sequences, and format variations. Malformed inputs are captured with contextual error information for later analysis.\n\n**Validation Engine**: Alpha applies configurable validation rules to incoming records. Validations include type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity checks, and custom business rules. Records failing validation are routed to error handling with detailed failure descriptions.\n\n**Buffering and Flow Control**: To manage throughput variations between sources and downstream processing, Alpha maintains internal buffers with configurable size limits. Back-pressure mechanisms prevent memory exhaustion when downstream modules cannot keep pace with ingestion rates.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VALIDATION_STRICT_MODE`, and `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK`. See `module-alpha.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n### Module Beta: Data Transformation\n\nModule Beta transforms ingested records into the format required by downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Schema Mapping**: Beta maps fields from the internal record format to target schemas. Mapping rules support field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic. Multiple output schemas can be active simultaneously.\n\n**Field Transformation**: Individual fields undergo transformation operations including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformation rules are evaluated in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent rules.\n\n**Data Enrichment**: Records can be enriched with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. Enrichment operations support caching to minimize repeated lookups for frequently referenced values.\n\n**Quality Scoring**: Each record receives a quality score based on completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns. Scores enable downstream consumers to make informed decisions about data reliability. Configurable thresholds trigger warnings or errors for low-quality records.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM`, `ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR`, and `MAX_TRANSFORM_TIME_MS`. See `module-beta.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n### Module Gamma: Data Output\n\nModule Gamma delivers transformed records to downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Format Rendering**: Records are rendered into output formats appropriate for each destination. Supported formats include JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom formats defined via templates. Rendering handles character encoding, escaping, and structural requirements.\n\n**Delivery Routing**: Records are routed to appropriate destinations based on content, quality scores, or configuration rules. Routing supports fan-out patterns where a single record is delivered to multiple destinations, as well as conditional routing based on record attributes.\n\n**Acknowledgment Handling**: Gamma tracks delivery status and processes acknowledgments from destinations. Successful deliveries update tracking records; failures trigger retry logic according to configured policies. Persistent failures route records to the dead letter queue.\n\n**Dead Letter Queue**: Records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts are written to a dead letter queue with comprehensive diagnostic information. Operators can inspect, correct, and replay failed records through administrative interfaces.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. See `module-gamma.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Data Flow\n\nData moves through the pipeline in a sequential, stage-gated process. This section describes the end-to-end flow from source ingestion through final delivery.\n\n### Stage 1: Source Acquisition\n\nThe pipeline execution begins when Module Alpha initiates data retrieval from configured sources. Source adapters establish connections, authenticate as necessary, and begin extracting data according to their specific protocols.\n\nFor pull-based sources (databases, APIs), Alpha issues queries or requests according to configured schedules or triggers. For push-based sources (message queues, file drops), Alpha monitors inbound channels and processes data as it arrives.\n\nRaw data is captured in its native format and passed to the parsing engine. Source metadata including origin identifier, extraction timestamp, and batch sequence number is attached to each data unit.\n\n### Stage 2: Parsing and Initial Validation\n\nThe parsing engine converts raw data into the pipeline's internal record format. Each source type has an associated parser that understands the source's data structure and extracts individual records.\n\nParsing failures generate detailed error records capturing the malformed input, error location, and failure reason. Failed parses are logged and routed to error handling; they do not halt processing of valid records.\n\nSuccessfully parsed records undergo initial validation in Module Alpha. Validation rules check basic data integrity including required field presence, type conformance, and format validity. Records passing validation proceed to the buffering queue.\n\n### Stage 3: Module Handoff (Alpha to Beta)\n\nWhen the Alpha output buffer reaches the configured batch threshold or a flush timeout expires, accumulated records are packaged into a transfer batch. The batch includes metadata identifying the source batch, record count, and checksum.\n\nThe integration layer mediates the handoff between Alpha and Beta. It validates batch integrity, manages flow control when Beta is processing slowly, and handles retry logic if the initial handoff fails. See `integration-layer.md` for handoff protocol details.\n\nBeta acknowledges batch receipt, at which point Alpha can release buffer space and proceed with additional ingestion. If acknowledgment is not received within the configured timeout, Alpha initiates retry procedures.\n\n### Stage 4: Transformation Processing\n\nModule Beta processes each record through its transformation pipeline. The transformation stages execute in sequence:\n\n**Schema Mapping** applies field mapping rules to convert records from the internal format to target schemas. Records may be mapped to multiple output schemas simultaneously.\n\n**Field Transformation** applies transformation rules to individual fields. Transformations execute in priority order, with each transformation potentially depending on results from earlier transformations.\n\n**Data Enrichment** augments records with data from external reference sources. The enrichment engine manages cache lookups, external service calls, and timeout handling.\n\n**Quality Scoring** evaluates each record against quality criteria and assigns a numeric score. Records below configured thresholds may be flagged, logged, or rejected depending on configuration.\n\n### Stage 5: Module Handoff (Beta to Gamma)\n\nTransformed records are batched for handoff to Module Gamma following the same batch protocol used between Alpha and Beta. The integration layer ensures reliable transfer with acknowledgment and retry support.\n\nBatch metadata is extended to include transformation summary statistics: record count, average quality score, error count, and enrichment hit rate. This metadata supports operational monitoring.\n\n### Stage 6: Output Rendering and Delivery\n\nModule Gamma receives transformed batches and routes individual records to their designated destinations. For each record:\n\n**Destination Determination** evaluates routing rules to identify target destinations. A record may have one or multiple destinations.\n\n**Format Rendering** converts the record to the format required by each destination. Rendering is performed independently for each destination, allowing different formats for the same record.\n\n**Delivery Execution** transmits the rendered record to the destination. The delivery engine manages connection pooling, authentication, and transmission protocols specific to each destination type.\n\n**Acknowledgment Processing** waits for confirmation of successful delivery. Confirmed records update completion tracking; failed records enter retry queues.\n\n### Stage 7: Completion and Reconciliation\n\nWhen all records in a batch have been delivered (or routed to dead letter queue after retry exhaustion), Gamma reports batch completion to upstream modules. Completion reports include delivery statistics: success count, retry count, DLQ count, and timing metrics.\n\nThe pipeline maintains end-to-end tracking that enables reconciliation between ingested and delivered records. Discrepancies trigger alerts for operator investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\nSeveral concerns span multiple modules and require coordinated implementation. This section describes these cross-cutting aspects and references their detailed specifications.\n\n### Error Handling Philosophy\n\nThe Data Pipeline System follows a \"fail forward\" error handling philosophy. Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. Instead, failed records are isolated, logged with diagnostic information, and routed to appropriate error handling channels while processing continues for valid records.\n\nError handling operates at multiple levels:\n\n**Record-Level Errors** affect individual records and are handled within the module where they occur. The record is marked as failed, diagnostic information is captured, and the record is routed to the module's error queue.\n\n**Batch-Level Errors** affect entire batches (e.g., network failures during handoff) and are handled by the integration layer's retry mechanisms.\n\n**Module-Level Errors** affect module operation (e.g., resource exhaustion) and may require operator intervention.\n\nEach module documents its specific error handling behaviors. For cross-module error propagation patterns, see `integration-layer.md`.\n\n### Logging and Observability\n\nAll modules emit structured log entries following a common format that enables log aggregation and analysis. Log entries include:\n\n- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n- Module identifier\n- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)\n- Correlation ID linking related entries\n- Structured payload with context-specific fields\n\nMetrics are emitted via a standard metrics interface supporting integration with Prometheus, StatsD, and similar platforms. Standard metrics include throughput rates, latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\nHealth check endpoints expose module status for load balancer and orchestration platform integration. See `integration-layer.md` for health check specifications.\n\n### Compliance and Audit Requirements\n\nThe pipeline supports compliance requirements through comprehensive audit logging and data lineage tracking. Audit events capture:\n\n- Data origin and ingestion timestamp\n- All transformation operations applied\n- Delivery confirmation with destination and timestamp\n- User or system actions affecting pipeline configuration\n\nAudit logs are retained according to configurable policies and can be exported to external audit systems. Compliance requirements are detailed in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSecurity is implemented through multiple mechanisms:\n\n**Transport Security**: All inter-module communication uses TLS encryption. External connections support TLS with certificate validation.\n\n**Authentication**: Source and destination connections use appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, certificates, database credentials).\n\n**Authorization**: Pipeline operations are governed by role-based access control. Configuration changes require elevated privileges.\n\n**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption supports scenarios where certain fields must remain protected through the pipeline.\n\nDetailed security requirements are specified in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Management\n\nPipeline configuration follows a hierarchical model where default values can be overridden at increasingly specific levels.\n\n### Configuration Hierarchy\n\n1. **System Defaults**: Built-in defaults for all configuration parameters\n2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)\n3. **Module Configuration**: Module-specific parameter overrides\n4. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Settings for specific sources or destinations\n\nLower levels in the hierarchy override higher levels, allowing targeted configuration while maintaining sensible defaults.\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\nEach module defines its configuration parameters in its detailed specification. Cross-module parameters defined in this overview include:\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `PIPELINE_NAME` | `default` | Identifier for this pipeline instance |\n| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum log level to emit |\n| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether to emit metrics |\n| `METRICS_PREFIX` | `datapipeline` | Prefix for metric names |\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` | `8080` | Port for health check endpoint |\n\n### Configuration Updates\n\nConfiguration changes can be applied without pipeline restart through the configuration reload mechanism. Modules detect configuration changes and apply them at safe points in processing.\n\nSome parameters require restart due to their nature (e.g., network ports, resource pool sizes). These are documented in module specifications.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Considerations\n\nThe Data Pipeline System supports various deployment models from single-node development environments to distributed production clusters.\n\n### Deployment Modes\n\n**Standalone Mode**: All modules run within a single process, suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. Inter-module communication uses in-memory queues.\n\n**Distributed Mode**: Each module runs as an independent service, communicating via network protocols. This mode supports horizontal scaling and fault isolation.\n\n**Hybrid Mode**: Selected modules are co-located while others run independently, balancing deployment complexity against scaling requirements.\n\n### Scaling Considerations\n\n**Module Alpha** scales based on source volume and variety. Multiple Alpha instances can partition source responsibility, or a single instance can handle multiple sources with connection pooling.\n\n**Module Beta** scales based on transformation complexity. Transformation is inherently parallelizable; adding Beta instances provides near-linear throughput improvement.\n\n**Module Gamma** scales based on destination count and delivery latency. Destinations with high latency may require dedicated Gamma instances to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### High Availability\n\nProduction deployments should include:\n\n- Multiple instances of each module for failover\n- Health monitoring with automatic instance replacement\n- Persistent queues between modules to prevent data loss during failures\n- Geographic distribution for disaster recovery scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Document References\n\nThis overview document provides architectural context for the Data Pipeline System.

No records are silently dropped.\n    63→\n    64→**Destination Agnosticism**: The core delivery logic remains independent of destination-specific protocols. Destination adapters encapsulate protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n    65→\n    66→**Ordered Delivery**: Within a single destination stream, records are delivered in the order received from Module Beta. Cross-destination ordering is not guaranteed.\n    67→\n    68→**Observable Operations**: All delivery stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis of delivery success rates and latencies.\n    69→\n    70→---\n    71→\n    72→## Output Destinations\n    73→\n    74→Module Gamma supports data delivery to multiple destination types through dedicated destination adapters.\n    75→\n    76→### Database Destinations\n    77→\n    78→Database destinations write records to relational and NoSQL databases:\n    79→- **Relational Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server via JDBC with batch insert optimization and upsert support\n    80→- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB with native driver integration and partition-aware routing\n    81→- **Connection Management**: Pooling with health checking, automatic reconnection, and graceful degradation\n    82→- **Write Modes**: Insert-only, upsert with configurable conflict resolution, append-only for time-series data\n    83→\n    84→### File System Destinations\n    85→\n    86→File system destinations write records to local or networked file systems:\n    87→- **Formats**: JSON (line-delimited or array), CSV, XML, Parquet with compression, Avro with schema evolution\n    88→- **File Management**: Rotation by size, record count, or time interval with atomic staging and rename-on-complete\n    89→- **Directory Structures**: Static paths, date-partitioned directories, content-based partitioning\n    90→\n    91→### API Destinations\n    92→\n    93→API destinations deliver records to external services via HTTP/HTTPS:\n    94→- **Authentication**: API keys, OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh, HTTP Basic, mutual TLS\n    95→- **Request Configuration**: Configurable HTTP methods, custom headers, request body templates\n    96→- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling, exponential backoff, and circuit breaker patterns\n    97→\n    98→### Message Queue Destinations\n    99→\n   100→Message queue destinations publish records to messaging systems:\n   101→- **Platforms**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Azure Service Bus, Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n   102→- **Delivery Semantics**: At-least-once with acknowledgment, exactly-once where supported\n   103→- **Partitioning**: Key-based partition selection, round-robin distribution, custom strategies\n   104→\n   105→### Destination Adapter Interface\n   106→\n   107→All destination adapters implement a common interface:\n   108→\n   109→```\n   110→DestinationAdapter Interface:\n   111→  - connect(): Establish connection to destination\n   112→  - disconnect(): Release connection resources\n   113→  - deliver(batch): Transmit batch of rendered records\n   114→  - get_delivery_status(batch_id): Query delivery confirmation status\n   115→  - get_metrics(): Return adapter-specific metrics\n   116→  - health_check(): Verify destination availability\n   117→```\n   118→\n   119→---\n   120→\n   121→## Data Structures\n   122→\n   123→Module Gamma defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n   124→\n   125→### DeliveryRequest\n   126→\n   127→Represents a batch received from Module Beta for output processing:\n   128→\n   129→```\n   130→DeliveryRequest:\n   131→  request_id: string            #

Gamma sends record to destination, destination processes and responds in same connection, response indicates success or failure, Gamma updates delivery status immediately.\n   334→\n   335→**Applicable To**: Database writes with commit confirmation, synchronous HTTP APIs, file writes with fsync.\n   336→\n   337→#### Asynchronous Acknowledgment\n   338→\n   339→Confirmation arrives separately from delivery. Gamma sends record with correlation ID, destination returns immediate acceptance, destination processes record asynchronously, destination sends acknowledgment via callback or polling, Gamma matches acknowledgment to original delivery.\n   340→\n   341→**Applicable To**: Message queues with consumer acknowledgment, webhook-based integrations, batch processing systems.\n   342→\n   343→#### Batch Acknowledgment\n   344→\n   345→Multiple records acknowledged together. Gamma sends batch of records, destination processes entire batch, single acknowledgment covers all records in batch, Gamma updates status for all batch members.\n   346→\n   347→**Applicable To**: Bulk database inserts, batch file uploads, streaming platforms with batch commit.\n   348→\n   349→### Acknowledgment Timeout Handling\n   350→\n   351→When acknowledgments do not arrive within expected timeframes, Gamma maintains acknowledgment deadlines for all pending deliveries. A background process monitors for expired deadlines.\n   352→\n   353→**Response Options**:\n   354→- **RETRY**: Redeliver and await new acknowledgment\n   355→- **POLL**: Query destination for delivery status\n   356→- **ESCALATE**: Route to error handling for manual review\n   357→- **DLQ**: Move to dead letter queue\n   358→\n   359→### Acknowledgment Persistence\n   360→\n   361→Acknowledgment state is persisted to survive restarts. Stored state includes pending acknowledgment records, correlation mappings, timeout deadlines, and retry counts. On startup, Gamma loads pending acknowledgments and resumes timeout monitoring. Records with expired timeouts are processed according to `timeout_action`.\n   362→\n   363→---\n   364→\n   365→## Error Handling\n   366→\n   367→Module Gamma implements comprehensive error handling following the reliable delivery principle: every record is either confirmed delivered or captured with diagnostic context for recovery.\n   368→\n   369→### Error Categories\n   370→\n   371→#### Rendering Errors\n   372→\n   373→Occur when format rendering operations fail to produce valid output.\n   374→\n   375→**Common Causes**: Unsupported data types for target format, encoding incompatibilities, schema violations, template syntax errors, buffer overflow for oversized records.\n   376→\n   377→**Handling**: Create RenderingFailure record with input data, target format, and specific error.

As the final stage in the pipeline, Module Gamma implements comprehensive format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management capabilities.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Format Rendering**: Converting transformed records into output formats appropriate for each destination. The rendering engine supports JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom template-based formats. Rendering handles character encoding, field escaping, structural requirements, and format-specific validation.\n\n**Delivery Routing**: Directing records to appropriate destinations based on content attributes, quality scores, or explicit routing rules. The routing engine supports fan-out delivery where a single record is sent to multiple destinations, conditional routing based on record attributes, and priority-based queue management.\n\n**Acknowledgment Handling**: Tracking delivery status and processing confirmations from downstream consumers. The acknowledgment engine manages synchronous and asynchronous acknowledgment patterns, timeout detection, and delivery state persistence for recovery scenarios.\n\n**Dead Letter Queue Management**: Capturing records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts. The DLQ subsystem provides inspection, correction, replay, and expiration capabilities with comprehensive diagnostic information.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Gamma processes records through a staged delivery pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MODULE GAMMA OUTPUT PIPELINE                            │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  From Beta ──▶ ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n│                │    Format    │    │   Delivery   │    │     Ack      │    │\n│                │   Renderer   │───▶│    Router    │───▶│   Handler    │    │\n│                └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    │\n│                       │                   │                   │             │\n│                       ▼                   ▼                   ▼             │\n│                ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    │\n│                │   Render     │    │   Delivery   │    │     Ack      │    │\n│                │   Errors     │    │   Failures   │    │   Timeouts   │    │\n│                └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    │\n│                                           │                                 │\n│                                    ┌──────▼──────┐                         │\n│                                    │  Dead Letter │                         │\n│                                    │    Queue     │───▶ Inspection/Replay   │\n│                                    └─────────────┘                         │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**Reliable Delivery**: Every record is either successfully delivered with acknowledgment, or captured in the dead letter queue with diagnostic context. No records are silently dropped.\n\n**Destination Agnosticism**: The core delivery logic remains independent of destination-specific protocols. Destination adapters encapsulate protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n\n**Ordered Delivery**: Within a single destination stream, records are delivered in the order received from Module Beta. Cross-destination ordering is not guaranteed.\n\n**Observable Operations**: All delivery stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis of delivery success rates and latencies.\n\n---\n\n## Output Destinations\n\nModule Gamma supports data delivery to multiple destination types through dedicated destination adapters.\n\n### Database Destinations\n\nDatabase destinations write records to relational and NoSQL databases:\n- **Relational Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server via JDBC with batch insert optimization and upsert support\n- **NoSQL Databases**: MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB with native driver integration and partition-aware routing\n- **Connection Management**: Pooling with health checking, automatic reconnection, and graceful degradation\n- **Write Modes**: Insert-only, upsert with configurable conflict resolution, append-only for time-series data\n\n### File System Destinations\n\nFile system destinations write records to local or networked file systems:\n- **Formats**: JSON (line-delimited or array), CSV, XML, Parquet with compression, Avro with schema evolution\n- **File Management**: Rotation by size, record count, or time interval with atomic staging and rename-on-complete\n- **Directory Structures**: Static paths, date-partitioned directories, content-based partitioning\n\n### API Destinations\n\nAPI destinations deliver records to external services via HTTP/HTTPS:\n- **Authentication**: API keys, OAuth 2.0 with automatic token refresh, HTTP Basic, mutual TLS\n- **Request Configuration**: Configurable HTTP methods, custom headers, request body templates\n- **Rate Limiting**: Throttling, exponential backoff, and circuit breaker patterns\n\n### Message Queue Destinations\n\nMessage queue destinations publish records to messaging systems:\n- **Platforms**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, Azure Service Bus, Google Cloud Pub/Sub\n- **Delivery Semantics**: At-least-once with acknowledgment, exactly-once where supported\n- **Partitioning**: Key-based partition selection, round-robin distribution, custom strategies\n\n### Destination Adapter Interface\n\nAll destination adapters implement a common interface:\n\n```\nDestinationAdapter Interface:\n  - connect(): Establish connection to destination\n  - disconnect(): Release connection resources\n  - deliver(batch): Transmit batch of rendered records\n  - get_delivery_status(batch_id): Query delivery confirmation status\n  - get_metrics(): Return adapter-specific metrics\n  - health_check(): Verify destination availability\n```\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Gamma defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### DeliveryRequest\n\nRepresents a batch received from Module Beta for output processing:\n\n```\nDeliveryRequest:\n  request_id: string            # UUID v4 generated by Module Beta\n  batch_id: string              # Links to transformation batch\n  records: list<TransformedRecord>\n  priority: enum                # NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL\n  delivery_profile: string      # Named delivery configuration\n  source_timestamp: datetime    # When batch left Module Beta\n  expiration: datetime          # Deadline for delivery attempts\n```\n\n### RenderedRecord\n\nRepresents a record after format rendering:\n\n```\nRenderedRecord:\n  record_id: string             #

Rule IDs evaluated\n  matched_rule: string          # Rule ID that matched\n  destinations: list<string>    # Selected destination IDs\n  routing_timestamp: datetime\n  routing_context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Formatting Rules\n\nModule Gamma implements a comprehensive formatting framework for output rendering.\n\n### Rule Categories\n\n- **Structural Rules**: Output structure and element ordering\n- **Encoding Rules**: Character encoding and escaping\n- **Type Rules**: Data type representation in output formats\n- **Null Rules**: Null and missing value handling\n- **Precision Rules**: Numeric precision and rounding\n\n### Standard Formatting Rules\n\n#### Rule 1: Field Inclusion Control\n\nDetermines which fields appear in rendered output.\n\n**Configuration**: `included_fields` (list), `excluded_fields` (list), `mode` (INCLUDE_ONLY, EXCLUDE_ONLY)\n\n**Behavior**: When `mode` is INCLUDE_ONLY, only fields in `included_fields` appear in output. When `mode` is EXCLUDE_ONLY, all fields except those in `excluded_fields` appear.\n\n#### Rule 2: Field Ordering\n\nControls the sequence of fields in rendered output.\n\n**Configuration**: `field_order` (list), `unspecified_position` (START, END, ALPHABETICAL)\n\n**Behavior**: Fields appear in the specified order. Fields not in the list are placed according to `unspecified_position`.\n\n#### Rule 3: Null Value Representation\n\nDefines how null values are rendered in output formats.\n\n**Configuration**: `null_representation` (map by format), `omit_null_fields` (boolean)\n\n**Behavior**: Null values are rendered according to format-specific rules. If `omit_null_fields` is true, fields with null values are excluded from output.\n\n#### Rule 4: Numeric Precision Control\n\nSpecifies decimal precision for numeric fields in output.\n\n**Configuration**: `precision_rules` (map), `default_precision` (integer), `rounding_mode`\n\n**Behavior**: Numeric fields are rounded to specified precision before rendering. Unspecified fields use `default_precision`.\n\n#### Rule 5: Date/Time Format Standardization\n\nControls datetime formatting in rendered output.\n\n**Configuration**: `datetime_format` (string), `timezone` (string), `include_timezone` (boolean)\n\n**Behavior**: All datetime fields are formatted according to the pattern and normalized to the specified timezone.\n\n#### Rule 6: String Escaping Policy\n\nDefines character escaping rules for string values.\n\n**Configuration**: `escape_rules` (map by format), `escape_unicode` (boolean)\n\n**Behavior**: Special characters are escaped according to format-specific rules. Unicode characters above U+007F are escaped if `escape_unicode` is enabled.\n\n#### Rule 7: Array Serialization Format\n\nControls how array fields are rendered.\n\n**Configuration**: `array_format` (NATIVE, DELIMITED, REPEATED), `delimiter` (string)\n\n**Behavior**: Arrays are serialized according to the specified format. NATIVE uses format-native arrays, DELIMITED joins elements with the delimiter, REPEATED creates multiple fields.\n\n### Rule Evaluation Order\n\n1. Field Inclusion Control (determine visible fields)\n2. Field Ordering (arrange field sequence)\n3. Null Value Representation (handle null values)\n4. Type-Specific Rules (numeric precision, datetime format)\n5. String Escaping (apply escaping rules)\n6. Array Serialization (format arrays)\n7. Final Validation (verify output conformance)\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgment Flow\n\nModule Gamma implements a comprehensive acknowledgment system to confirm successful delivery.\n\n### Acknowledgment Patterns\n\n#### Synchronous Acknowledgment\n\nThe delivery call returns confirmation before completing. Gamma sends record to destination, destination processes and responds in same connection, response indicates success or failure, Gamma updates delivery status immediately.\n\n**Applicable To**: Database writes with commit confirmation, synchronous HTTP APIs, file writes with fsync.\n\n#### Asynchronous Acknowledgment\n\nConfirmation arrives separately from delivery. Gamma sends record with correlation ID, destination returns immediate acceptance, destination processes record asynchronously, destination sends acknowledgment via callback or polling, Gamma matches acknowledgment to original delivery.\n\n**Applicable To**: Message queues with consumer acknowledgment, webhook-based integrations, batch processing systems.\n\n#### Batch Acknowledgment\n\nMultiple records acknowledged together. Gamma sends batch of records, destination processes entire batch, single acknowledgment covers all records in batch, Gamma updates status for all batch members.\n\n**Applicable To**: Bulk database inserts, batch file uploads, streaming platforms with batch commit.\n\n### Acknowledgment Timeout Handling\n\nWhen acknowledgments do not arrive within expected timeframes, Gamma maintains acknowledgment deadlines for all pending deliveries. A background process monitors for expired deadlines.\n\n**Response Options**:\n- **RETRY**: Redeliver and await new acknowledgment\n- **POLL**: Query destination for delivery status\n- **ESCALATE**: Route to error handling for manual review\n- **DLQ**: Move to dead letter queue\n\n### Acknowledgment Persistence\n\nAcknowledgment state is persisted to survive restarts. Stored state includes pending acknowledgment records, correlation mappings, timeout deadlines, and retry counts. On startup, Gamma loads pending acknowledgments and resumes timeout monitoring. Records with expired timeouts are processed according to `timeout_action`.\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nModule Gamma implements comprehensive error handling following the reliable delivery principle: every record is either confirmed delivered or captured with diagnostic context for recovery.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### Rendering Errors\n\nOccur when format rendering operations fail to produce valid output.\n\n**Common Causes**: Unsupported data types for target format, encoding incompatibilities, schema violations, template syntax errors, buffer overflow for oversized records.\n\n**Handling**: Create RenderingFailure record with input data, target format, and specific error. Route to rendering error queue. If rendering failure rate exceeds `RENDER_ERROR_THRESHOLD`, suspend processing and alert operators.\n\n**RenderingFailure Structure**:\n```\nRenderingFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  target_format: string\n  input_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"RENDER_001_UNSUPPORTED_TYPE\"\n  error_message: string\n  field_name: string            # Field that caused failure\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `gamma_render_errors_total`, `gamma_render_error_rate`, `gamma_render_errors_by_format`\n\n#### Routing Errors\n\nOccur when delivery routing cannot determine appropriate destinations.\n\n**Common Causes**: No matching routing rules, circular routing dependencies, disabled destinations, invalid destination configuration.\n\n**Handling**: Log routing context and route record to routing error queue. Records without valid destinations cannot proceed to delivery.\n\n**RoutingError Structure**:\n```\nRoutingError:\n  record_id: string\n  evaluated_rules: list<string>\n  routing_context: map<string, string>\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ROUTE_002_NO_MATCHING_RULE\"\n  error_message: string\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `gamma_routing_errors_total`, `gamma_routing_errors_by_rule`\n\n#### Connection Errors\n\nOccur when destination adapters cannot establish or maintain connectivity.\n\n**Common Causes**: Network unavailability, DNS resolution failure, TLS handshake errors, authentication failures, connection pool exhaustion, destination service outage.\n\n**Handling**: Retry with exponential backoff up to `MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES`. When retry limit exceeded, open circuit breaker for destination. Records targeting circuit-broken destinations enter a holding queue until circuit closes.\n\n**ConnectionError Structure**:\n```\nConnectionError:\n  destination_id: string\n  error_type: enum              # NETWORK, DNS, TLS, AUTH, POOL, SERVICE\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"CONN_003_TLS_HANDSHAKE\"\n  error_message: string\n  retry_count: integer\n  circuit_state: enum           # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Configuration**: `CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` (failures before opening), `CIRCUIT_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS` (time before half-open), `CIRCUIT_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD` (successes to close).\n\n#### Delivery Errors\n\nOccur when transmission to destination fails despite successful connection.\n\n**Common Causes**: Destination rejection (validation failure, duplicate key), timeout during transmission, partial delivery failure, rate limiting, quota exhaustion.\n\n**Transient Errors** (timeout, rate limit): Retry with backoff. Track rate limit headers and respect retry-after directives.\n\n**Permanent Errors** (validation failure, duplicate): Route to DLQ without retry. Capture destination response for diagnosis.\n\n**DeliveryError Structure**:\n```\nDeliveryError:\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  attempt_number: integer\n  error_type: enum              # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"DELIV_004_RATE_LIMITED\"\n  destination_response: string\n  retry_eligible: boolean\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n#### Acknowledgment Errors\n\nOccur when delivery completes but acknowledgment processing fails.\n\n**Common Causes**: Acknowledgment timeout, malformed acknowledgment payload, correlation ID mismatch, acknowledgment callback failure.\n\n**Handling**: Acknowledgment errors are ambiguous—delivery may have succeeded. Apply `ACK_TIMEOUT_ACTION` configuration: RETRY_DELIVERY (risk: duplicates), ASSUME_SUCCESS (risk: lost records), QUERY_DESTINATION, or MANUAL_REVIEW.\n\n**AcknowledgmentError Structure**:\n```\nAcknowledgmentError:\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  ack_type: enum                # SYNC, ASYNC, BATCH\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ACK_002_TIMEOUT\"\n  error_message: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  expected_by: datetime\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Errors\n\nOccur when system resources are depleted during output processing.\n\n**Common Causes**: Memory pressure from large batches, thread pool saturation, file handle exhaustion, disk space depletion, network buffer overflow.\n\n**Handling**: Graceful degradation: signal back-pressure to Module Beta, complete in-flight deliveries, pause new batch acceptance, release non-essential resources, resume when resources recover.\n\n**Degradation Levels**: LEVEL_1 (reduce batch sizes), LEVEL_2 (pause low-priority destinations), LEVEL_3 (pause all batches, drain queues), LEVEL_4 (controlled shutdown with state persistence).\n\n### Error Queue Management\n\nFailed records route to categorized error queues: `gamma_render_errors`, `gamma_routing_errors`, `gamma_delivery_errors`, `gamma_ack_errors`, `gamma_dlq`.\n\n**Queue Operations**:\n- **Inspection**: Query failed records with filters by error type, destination, time range\n- **Correction**: Update record content or routing to resolve identified issues\n- **Replay**: Reinject records into delivery pipeline respecting current routing rules\n- **Expiration**: Records exceeding retention period are purged\n- **Bulk Operations**: Export, bulk replay with rate limiting, bulk expiration\n\n**Configuration**: `ERROR_QUEUE_CAPACITY`, `RENDER_ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `DELIVERY_ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS`\n\n### Error Logging\n\nAll errors generate structured log entries:\n\n```\nOutputErrorLog:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  level: enum                   # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL\n  error_category: string\n  error_code: string\n  message: string\n  record_id: string\n  destination_id: string\n  batch_id: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  attempt_number: integer\n  context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n**Log Levels**: DEBUG (detailed diagnostics), INFO (normal events), WARN (recoverable issues), ERROR (failed operations), CRITICAL (system-level failures).\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `gamma_errors_total` (by category), `gamma_retries_total` (by destination), `gamma_dlq_entries_total`, `gamma_circuit_breaker_trips`\n\n**Gauges**: `gamma_error_queue_size`, `gamma_circuit_breaker_state`, `gamma_pending_acks`\n\n**Histograms**: `gamma_error_recovery_duration`, `gamma_retry_delay_seconds`, `gamma_dlq_age_seconds`\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n**Rendering Recovery**: Log failure → capture input state → route to queue → continue processing → alert if threshold exceeded.\n\n**Routing Recovery**: Log context → route to queue → apply default routing if configured → continue or hold.\n\n**Connection Recovery**: Detect failure → close resources → exponential backoff → reconnect → verify health → resume or escalate.\n\n**Delivery Recovery**: Capture response → classify error → retry if transient → DLQ if permanent → update metrics.\n\n**Acknowledgment Recovery**: Detect timeout → apply configured action → log ambiguity → update tracking.\n\n**Resource Recovery**: Detect pressure → signal back-pressure → drain queues → release resources → wait → resume gradually.\n\n### Error Escalation\n\nWhen error rates exceed configured thresholds, the system escalates:\n\n**Level 1 - Warning**: Elevated error rates logged, alert metrics emitted.\n\n**Level 2 - Throttle**: Reduce intake from Module Beta, prioritize critical deliveries.\n\n**Level 3 - Circuit Break**: Open circuit breakers for failing destinations.\n\n**Level 4 - Halt**: Suspend all processing pending operator intervention, persist state for recovery.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nModule Gamma behavior is controlled through configuration parameters.\n\n### Delivery Configuration\n\n#### OUTPUT_BATCH_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 500 | **Range**: 1-10000\n\nRecords processed per delivery batch. Larger sizes improve throughput but increase memory usage and latency.\n\n#### MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5 | **Range**: 0-50\n\nMaximum retry attempts before routing to dead letter queue.

Subsequent retries apply backoff multiplier.\n\n#### RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 2.0 | **Range**: 1.0-10.0\n\nMultiplier applied to retry delay after each attempt.\n\n### Acknowledgment Configuration\n\n#### ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 60000 | **Range**: 1000-600000\n\nMaximum time to wait for asynchronous acknowledgments.\n\n#### ACK_TIMEOUT_ACTION\n\n**Type**: Enum | **Default**: RETRY_DELIVERY | **Values**: RETRY_DELIVERY, ASSUME_SUCCESS, QUERY_DESTINATION, MANUAL_REVIEW\n\nAction taken when acknowledgment timeout occurs.\n\n### Rendering Configuration\n\n#### DEFAULT_OUTPUT_FORMAT\n\n**Type**: String | **Default**: \"JSON\" | **Values**: JSON, XML, CSV, AVRO, PARQUET\n\nDefault format when destination does not specify format preference.\n\n#### MAX_RECORD_SIZE_BYTES\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 10485760 | **Range**: 1024-1073741824\n\nMaximum size of rendered record. Records exceeding limit are routed to error handling.\n\n### Dead Letter Queue Configuration\n\n#### DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 30 | **Range**: 1-365\n\nDays to retain records in dead letter queue before automatic purge.\n\n#### DLQ_MAX_ENTRIES\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 100000 | **Range**: 1000-10000000\n\nMaximum entries in dead letter queue.

Incomplete Integration Layer Error Propagation Scope (Task 2.4)**\n\nTask 2.4 says \"Update the Integration Layer to use Error Registry for all inter-module error propagation.\" However, `integration-layer.md` Section 5 already defines a comprehensive error propagation framework including:\n- `IntegrationError` structure with `error_code`, `ErrorContext`, severity/recoverability/scope classifications\n- `BatchErrorSummary` and `ErrorNotification` messages\n- Circuit breaker state coordination (`CircuitBreakerState`, `CircuitStateChange`)\n\n**Issue:** The task is too vague. Does \"use Error Registry\" mean:\n- (a) The Integration Layer becomes a consumer of the registry?\n- (b) The Integration Layer IS the registry?\n- (c) Both the existing propagation mechanisms AND a new registry coexist?\n\n---\n\n**3. Compliance Requirements Section Missing from WPD**\n\n`compliance-requirements.md` Section 3 defines strict audit logging requirements including:\n- Requirement 3.1: All audit log entries must include specific fields\n- Requirement 3.4: Audit logs must be synchronized within 1 second\n- Requirement 3.5: Cryptographic checksums at configurable intervals\n\nThe WPD mentions \"Update audit logging to use standardized error formats\" (Task 3.3) but doesn't reference these compliance requirements or explain how the Error Registry will satisfy them.\n\n---\n\n**4. Missing Specification Update Tasks**\n\nPer Agent Rule 3.5, specifications must be updated when code changes. This refactor would require updates to:\n- `module-alpha.md` Section 5 (Error Handling) - currently 150+ lines\n- `module-beta.md` Section 5 (Error Handling) - currently 145+ lines\n- `module-gamma.md` Section 6 (Error Handling) - currently 175+ lines\n- `integration-layer.md` Section 5 (Error Propagation) - currently 150+ lines\n\n**Issue:** No Phase addresses specification updates. This is a critical omission.\n\n---\n\n### **Significant Findings**\n\n**5. Undefined ErrorRegistry Interface (Task 1.1)**\n\nTask 1.1 says \"Design the ErrorRegistry interface with methods for error registration, lookup, and creation\" but provides no guidance on:\n- Whether it's a singleton, service, or library\n- Thread-safety requirements (all modules are multi-threaded per specs)\n- Persistence model (is the registry in-memory, config-file-based, or database-backed?)\n- Hot-reload capability (specs mention config can be updated without restart)\n\n---\n\n**6. Severity Level Mismatch**\n\nTask 1.4 proposes severity levels: `CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO`\n\nBut the existing specifications use inconsistent severity terminology:\n- Module Alpha `ValidationFailure`: `WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL` (no INFO)\n- Module Alpha `ErrorLogEntry.level`: `DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL`\n- Integration Layer: `CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING` (no INFO, uses WARNING not WARN)\n\n**Issue:** The WPD doesn't clarify whether the Error Registry will standardize these or maintain backward compatibility with existing severity enums.\n\n---\n\n**7. Missing Error Recovery Hint Structure**\n\nTask 1.2 mentions \"recovery hints\" in `ErrorDefinition` but doesn't define:\n- What format recovery hints take\n- Whether hints are static text, actionable commands, or references to procedures\n- How hints relate to the existing `suggested_action` field in Module Alpha's `ValidationFailure` or `is_recoverable` flags throughout all modules\n\n---\n\n**8. Phase 3 Observability Tasks Lack Success Criteria**\n\nPhase 3 tasks (3.1-3.4) are vague:\n- \"Implement error correlation tracking\" - but `correlation_id` already exists throughout all specs\n- \"Create error metrics integration\" - but error metrics already exist (`alpha_errors_total`, `beta_errors_total`, `gamma_errors_total`, `integration_errors_total`)\n- \"Implement error recovery suggestion lookup\" - no definition of what \"lookup\" means\n\n**Issue:** These tasks may duplicate existing functionality. Needs clarification on what's NEW vs. what's REPLACING existing implementations.\n\n---\n\n**9. No Task for Circuit Breaker Coordination**\n\nThe Integration Layer specifies circuit breaker coordination patterns (`CircuitBreakerState`, `CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, etc.). Each module has its own circuit breaker configuration.\n\n**Issue:** If error definitions move to a central registry, circuit breaker coordination logic should too, but there's no task for this.\n\n---\n\n**10. Missing Dead Letter Queue Integration**\n\nModule Gamma manages DLQ with `DeadLetterEntry` containing `failure_reason` and `failure_details`. Module Beta has `beta_critical_errors` queue.\n\n**Issue:** Task 2.3 mentions \"acknowledgment errors\" but doesn't mention how the Error Registry integrates with DLQ entries and their existing failure capture.\n\n---\n\n### **Observations (Lower Priority)**\n\n**11.** The WPD has no Phase 0 section (correct - this is a new plan, not one with discovered blockers)\n\n**12.** Task 1.3's namespaces don't include a namespace for compliance-specific errors (compliance requirements doc has its own logging structure)\n\n**13.** No task for updating health check integration - `module-alpha.md`, `module-beta.md`, and `module-gamma.md` all have health status levels that may need coordination with error registry\n\n---\n\n### **Recommended Investigations**\n\nBefore proceeding, we should clarify:\n\n1. **Investigation A**: What is the migration strategy for existing error codes? (Finding 1)\n2. **Investigation B**: What is the relationship between Error Registry and Integration Layer's existing error propagation? (Finding 2)\n3. **Investigation C**: Should this WPD include specification update tasks? (Finding 4)\n\n---\n\nWhat would you like to discuss first, or shall I proceed with adding tasks to address these gaps?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":12568,"cache_read_input_tokens":133485,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":12568,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1733,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXA4X7n7snWCR3nDcxTL6","type":"assistant","uuid":"0822042f-4648-4366-9684-dea3d1e5be08","timestamp":"2026-01-15T23:51:52.498Z"}

All my Read operations returned inline content that I was able to analyze directly.\n\nI should report this accurately to the user.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":130198,"cache_read_input_tokens":20034,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":130198,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":7,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXA4cdzChVy7wLivYSZ2t","type":"assistant","uuid":"0057564e-0fe9-4514-87f4-835807ca9ef9","timestamp":"2026-01-15T23:52:41.747Z"}
