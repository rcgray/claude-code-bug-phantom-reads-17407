Do not skip or skim these sections - they contain the most important customized instructions for this specific project. **Follow the instructions and rules within them.**\n\n## Usage\n\n```\n/wsd:init [--custom | workscope-directive]\n```\n\nWhere:\n- `--custom` instructs the agent to skip Task-Master assignment and return to the User for a custom workscope\n- `workscope-directive` is a message forwarded to Task-Master to guide workscope selection\n\nThese options are mutually exclusive. Most common usage is simply `/wsd:init` with no arguments.\n\n## Examples\n\n```\n/wsd:init\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init Do all of Phase 5, but not Phase 6\n```\n\n```\n/wsd:init --custom\n```\n\n---\n\n## Project Introduction\n\n<WORKSCOPE-DEV wsd-init-project-introduction>\n\nThis is the \"Phantom Reads Investigation\" project: a `git` repository intended for publishing on GitHub that provides an experiment to reproduce Claude Code Issue #17407 (\"Phantom Reads\"). The issue can be viewed publicly at: `https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17407`. Users can clone this repository to read more about the issue, its discovery, and to reproduce the issue on their own machines.\n\nPlease read:\n- `docs/core/PRD.md`\n- `docs/core/Experiment-Methodology.md`\n- `docs/core/Action-Plan.md`\n\n</WORKSCOPE-DEV>\n\nFirst Directive: Print a message acknowledging that you read the content in the `wsd-init-project-introduction` section immediately above and followed all directions therein.\n\n## Workscope System\n\nRun the `/wsd:boot` command to read the necessary files for understanding the Workscope-Dev Platform. When it is complete, return here and finish the remaining instructions.\n\n## Workscope ID Generation\n\nGenerate a unique Workscope ID for this session based on the current timestamp:\n\n1. Run the `date` command to get the current timestamp\n2. Report your Workscope ID, which is derived from this timestamp according to the pattern: `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS`\n\n**Remember this Workscope ID** as you will use it throughout your session for:\n- Work Journal naming\n- Workscope file naming (if fetching from Task-Master)\n- All agent communications\n\n## Work Journal\n\nYour next preparation task is to start a new \"Work Journal\" for YOUR fresh session with the Workscope ID:\n\n**CRITICAL - Work Journal in Archive Location:**\n\nRun the Work Journal initialization script, substituting your Workscope ID in the command below. Note that `[Workscope ID]` is strictly the `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS` identifier, with no added prefix or suffix:\n\n(bash):\n   bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh \"[Workscope ID]\"\n\nThis script will create a new Work Journal directly in the archive location at `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`. Verify that this file exists and was properly formed (with the correct filename).\n\nThis file is now YOUR \"Work Journal,\" and you will be continually adding to it over the course of YOUR session as you proceed through your workscope. Be sure to update your Work Journal after each step so this real time monitoring can take place.\n\n**CRITICAL**: `cat >> file << EOF` IS FORBIDDEN. It is an anti-pattern that will likely result in full rejection of your contributions. Do NOT use terminal commands (such as `cat` or `echo` with `>>`) to write to files. Use your standard tools (e.g., Read, Edit, etc.) to interact with files throughout your session. You will be reminded of this as **Rule 4.4** in the Agent Rules.\n\n## Task-Master Assignment (Conditional)\n\n**IF `$1` is `--custom`:**\n- Run the `/wsd:onboard` command and return to this command\n- Skip the rest of this section and continue to \"## Completion Behavior\"\n- You will receive your workscope directly from the User after this command completes\n\n**OTHERWISE (including if `$1` is empty):**\n- Consult @agent-task-master to fetch your workscope assignment\n- Provide the Task-Master with your Workscope ID that you generated earlier\n- Workscope directive (forward to Task-Master if provided): $1\n\nThe Task-Master has complete instructions in its definition and will:\n  - Create a workscope file at `dev/workscopes/archive/Workscope-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`\n  - Mark the selected tasks with `[*]` in the relevant checkboxlists\n  - Return the workscope file path to you\n\nRead the workscope file. **FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE**: Your workscope will assign SPECIFIC TASK NUMBERS (e.g., \"3.5, 3.6, 3.7\") for execution. While you should understand the entire phase as context for how your tasks fit into the larger picture, you are responsible for EXECUTING only your assigned task numbers.\n\nMANDATORY: After reading your workscope file, literally copy the ENTIRE, VERBATIM content of the workscope document into the Work Journal. Do this before moving on to the next step. The User will read your Work Journal, and if the User does not see the exact, verbatim text of your workscope file present in the Work Journal after it was assigned to you by the Task-Master agent, your entire session will be immediately terminated.\n\n### Phase Inventory Validation\n\nBefore accepting, check the Phase Inventory for this error: \"CLEAR (all [%])\" or any \"CLEAR\" with a qualifier. Phases with `[%]` items are NOT CLEAR.\n\nIf you detect this error: Reject the workscope. Tell Task-Master to delete the invalid workscope file and redo the assignment correctly. This is the one exception to workscope immutability—an invalid workscope must be replaced.\n\n## Completion Behavior\n\nUpon completing the initialization steps above, return to the User with a clear message at the END of your reply.\n\nMANDATORY: Put the following text at the END of your reply, verbatim:\n**\"WORKSCOPE INITIALIZATION (/wsd:init) COMPLETE. To continue this work: propose changes, describe the workscope, or `/wsd:prepare`. To abandon completely, `/wsd:abort`.\"**\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe command should handle these error conditions:\n\n1. **Agent communication failures**: Retry agent communications if they fail\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --custom"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"b47ec2f2-09a6-4bf3-87eb-b536098547be","timestamp":"2026-01-15T23:54:30.857Z"}

Public README\n    56→\n    57→A user-facing README.md that:\n    58→- Links to the official GitHub issue (#17407)\n    59→- Explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon in accessible terms\n    60→- Documents the experiment methodology and findings\n    61→- Provides step-by-step reproduction instructions\n    62→- Includes guidance on installing specific Claude Code versions for testing\n    63→\n    64→### 2. Reproduction Experiment\n    65→\n    66→A structured environment designed to trigger phantom reads:\n    67→- Inter-related documentation files that prompt multi-file read operations\n    68→- A Work Plan Document (ticket) that serves as the target for the `/refine-plan` command\n    69→- The `/refine-plan` custom command, which triggers deep investigation across specifications and documentation\n    70→\n    71→The experiment leverages the Workscope-Dev (WSD) framework already present in this repository. The `/refine-plan` command naturally triggers reads across multiple files in `docs/read-only/standards/`, `docs/core/`, and related locations—the exact pattern observed to trigger phantom reads in the original investigation.\n    72→\n    73→### 3.

The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude to treat this marker as if it were the actual content, proceeding without the follow-up read.\n    97→\n    98→### Version History\n    99→\n   100→Testing across Claude Code versions revealed two distinct eras of phantom read behavior:\n   101→\n   102→| Era | Versions        | Error Mechanism                     | Notes                      |\n   103→| --- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n   104→| 1   | 2.0.54 - 2.0.59 | `[Old tool result content cleared]` | Context clearing mechanism |\n   105→| 2   | 2.0.60 - 2.1.6+ | `<persisted-output>`                | Disk persistence mechanism |\n   106→\n   107→**Important**: The original investigation incorrectly concluded that versions 2.0.58 and earlier were unaffected. Subsequent testing confirmed that ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads—the mechanism simply differs between eras.\n   108→\n   109→The transition from Era 1 to Era 2 occurs at the 2.0.59/2.0.60 boundary, suggesting a change in how Claude Code handles large tool results around that release.\n   110→\n   111→### Trigger Conditions\n   112→\n   113→Based on the original investigation, phantom reads appear more likely to occur when:\n   114→\n   115→1. **Multi-file operations**: Commands that trigger reads across multiple files in a single conversation turn\n   116→2. **Custom commands**: Execution context initiated via slash commands (e.g., `/refine-plan`)\n   117→3. **Large file sets**: Operations involving numerous related documents\n   118→\n   119→The exact conditions that determine whether a specific read becomes a phantom read remain under investigation.\n   120→\n   121→## Experiment Methodology\n   122→\n   123→The original investigation followed a systematic protocol to test multiple Claude Code versions and identify version boundaries. The full methodology from the original investigation is preserved in:\n   124→\n   125→**[Experiment-Methodology-01.md](Experiment-Methodology-01.md)** (historical document with addendum)\n   126→\n   127→### Summary\n   128→\n   129→The investigation used a self-report methodology: trigger multi-file read operations via `/wsd:init --custom` followed by `/refine-plan`, then prompt the agent to report whether any phantom reads occurred.\n   130→\n   131→**Original findings** (later revised):\n   132→- Pre-2.0.59 versions appeared unaffected\n   133→- Post-2.0.59 versions showed consistent failures\n   134→\n   135→**Revised understanding**:\n   136→- ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads\n   137→- Era 1 (2.0.59 and earlier): `[Old tool result content cleared]` mechanism\n   138→- Era 2 (2.0.60 and later): `<persisted-output>` mechanism\n   139→- The original investigation likely conflated the two mechanisms\n   140→\n   141→For ongoing investigation notes, see `Investigation-Journal.md`.\n   142→\n   143→### Limitations\n   144→\n   145→The self-report methodology has inherent limitations (model incentives, introspection accuracy, non-determinism). Additionally, the original investigation failed to distinguish between the two phantom read mechanisms, leading to incorrect conclusions about \"safe\" versions. The analysis tools in this repository address these limitations by examining session logs programmatically, removing the model from the detection loop.\n   146→\n   147→## Architecture Overview\n   148→\n   149→### Repository Structure\n   150→\n   151→```\n   152→├── README.md                        # User-facing documentation\n   153→├── docs/\n   154→│   ├── core/\n   155→│   │   ├── PRD.md                  # This document (internal)\n   156→│   │   ├── Action-Plan.md          # Implementation checkboxlist\n   157→│   │   ├── Design-Decisions.md     # Project design rationale\n   158→│   │   ├── Investigation-Journal.md # Running log of discoveries\n   159→│   │   └── Experiment-Methodology-01.md # Original methodology (historical)\n   160→│   ├── read-only/                  # WSD standards (read triggers)\n   161→│   ├── tickets/\n   162→│   │   └── open/                   # WPD targets for /refine-plan\n   163→│   └── workbench/                  # Working documents\n   164→├── dev/\n   165→│   └── misc/                       # Session samples (good/bad cases by version)\n   166→├── scripts/\n   167→│   ├── archive_claude_sessions.py  # Session archival utility\n   168→│   └── analyze_phantom_reads.py    # Phantom read detector (to build)\n   169→└── .claude/\n   170→    └── commands/\n   171→        └── refine-plan.md          # Trigger command\n   172→```\n   173→\n   174→### Key Components\n   175→\n   176→**Trigger Mechanism**: The `/refine-plan` command executed against a ticket in `docs/tickets/open/`.

The bug manifests differently across versions:\n\n- **Era 1 (versions 2.0.59 and earlier)**: Read results are cleared from context, replaced with `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages. The agent proceeds without the content.\n- **Era 2 (versions 2.0.60 and later)**: Large read results are persisted to disk, returning `<persisted-output>` markers.

For example, we have a pair of sessions in `dev/misc/example-sessions/` called `2.1.6-good` (success) and `2.1.6-bad` (phantom read) that were generated in that build.\n- \"Flat Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file and the breakout agent session files are stored adjacent in a directory, with only their session IDs to link them. This is an older architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n- \"Hierarchical Architecture\": A session (`.jsonl` files) in which the core session file is accompanied by a directory of the same name, which stores all of the breakout agent session files associated with that core session as well as any tool outputs. This is the newer (current) architecture that changed somewhere between build `2.0.60` and `2.1.3`.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### 1. Public README\n\nA user-facing README.md that:\n- Links to the official GitHub issue (#17407)\n- Explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon in accessible terms\n- Documents the experiment methodology and findings\n- Provides step-by-step reproduction instructions\n- Includes guidance on installing specific Claude Code versions for testing\n\n### 2. Reproduction Experiment\n\nA structured environment designed to trigger phantom reads:\n- Inter-related documentation files that prompt multi-file read operations\n- A Work Plan Document (ticket) that serves as the target for the `/refine-plan` command\n- The `/refine-plan` custom command, which triggers deep investigation across specifications and documentation\n\nThe experiment leverages the Workscope-Dev (WSD) framework already present in this repository. The `/refine-plan` command naturally triggers reads across multiple files in `docs/read-only/standards/`, `docs/core/`, and related locations—the exact pattern observed to trigger phantom reads in the original investigation.\n\n### 3. Session Analysis Tools\n\nPython scripts in `scripts/` that:\n- Parse Claude Code session `.jsonl` files\n- Identify Read tool invocations that returned phantom read indicators:\n  - Era 2: `<persisted-output>` responses without follow-up reads\n  - Era 1: `[Old tool result content cleared]` messages\n- Report phantom read occurrences with file paths and conversation context\n\nThese tools provide objective, programmatic detection that does not rely on the AI's self-assessment of whether it experienced phantom reads.\n\n## Technical Background\n\n### How Claude Code Handles Large Outputs\n\nWhen a tool result exceeds a size threshold, Claude Code persists the output to disk and returns a marker in this format:\n\n```\n<persisted-output>Tool result saved to: /path/to/file.txt\n\nUse Read to view</persisted-output>\n```\n\nThe AI is expected to recognize this marker and issue a follow-up Read command to retrieve the actual content. The Phantom Reads bug causes Claude to treat this marker as if it were the actual content, proceeding without the follow-up read.\n\n### Version History\n\nTesting across Claude Code versions revealed two distinct eras of phantom read behavior:\n\n| Era | Versions        | Error Mechanism                     | Notes                      |\n| --- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |\n| 1   | 2.0.54 - 2.0.59 | `[Old tool result content cleared]` | Context clearing mechanism |\n| 2   | 2.0.60 - 2.1.6+ | `<persisted-output>`                | Disk persistence mechanism |\n\n**Important**: The original investigation incorrectly concluded that versions 2.0.58 and earlier were unaffected. Subsequent testing confirmed that ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads—the mechanism simply differs between eras.\n\nThe transition from Era 1 to Era 2 occurs at the 2.0.59/2.0.60 boundary, suggesting a change in how Claude Code handles large tool results around that release.\n\n### Trigger Conditions\n\nBased on the original investigation, phantom reads appear more likely to occur when:\n\n1. **Multi-file operations**: Commands that trigger reads across multiple files in a single conversation turn\n2. **Custom commands**: Execution context initiated via slash commands (e.g., `/refine-plan`)\n3. **Large file sets**: Operations involving numerous related documents\n\nThe exact conditions that determine whether a specific read becomes a phantom read remain under investigation.\n\n## Experiment Methodology\n\nThe original investigation followed a systematic protocol to test multiple Claude Code versions and identify version boundaries. The full methodology from the original investigation is preserved in:\n\n**[Experiment-Methodology-01.md](Experiment-Methodology-01.md)** (historical document with addendum)\n\n### Summary\n\nThe investigation used a self-report methodology: trigger multi-file read operations via `/wsd:init --custom` followed by `/refine-plan`, then prompt the agent to report whether any phantom reads occurred.\n\n**Original findings** (later revised):\n- Pre-2.0.59 versions appeared unaffected\n- Post-2.0.59 versions showed consistent failures\n\n**Revised understanding**:\n- ALL tested versions can exhibit phantom reads\n- Era 1 (2.0.59 and earlier): `[Old tool result content cleared]` mechanism\n- Era 2 (2.0.60 and later): `<persisted-output>` mechanism\n- The original investigation likely conflated the two mechanisms\n\nFor ongoing investigation notes, see `Investigation-Journal.md`.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThe self-report methodology has inherent limitations (model incentives, introspection accuracy, non-determinism). Additionally, the original investigation failed to distinguish between the two phantom read mechanisms, leading to incorrect conclusions about \"safe\" versions. The analysis tools in this repository address these limitations by examining session logs programmatically, removing the model from the detection loop.\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\n### Repository Structure\n\n```\n├── README.md                        # User-facing documentation\n├── docs/\n│   ├── core/\n│   │   ├── PRD.md                  # This document (internal)\n│   │   ├── Action-Plan.md          # Implementation checkboxlist\n│   │   ├── Design-Decisions.md     # Project design rationale\n│   │   ├── Investigation-Journal.md # Running log of discoveries\n│   │   └── Experiment-Methodology-01.md # Original methodology (historical)\n│   ├── read-only/                  # WSD standards (read triggers)\n│   ├── tickets/\n│   │   └── open/                   # WPD targets for /refine-plan\n│   └── workbench/                  # Working documents\n├── dev/\n│   └── misc/                       # Session samples (good/bad cases by version)\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── archive_claude_sessions.py  # Session archival utility\n│   └── analyze_phantom_reads.py    # Phantom read detector (to build)\n└── .claude/\n    └── commands/\n        └── refine-plan.md          # Trigger command\n```\n\n### Key Components\n\n**Trigger Mechanism**: The `/refine-plan` command executed against a ticket in `docs/tickets/open/`. This command prompts deep investigation across multiple documentation files, creating the multi-file read pattern associated with phantom reads.\n\n**Detection Mechanism**: Python scripts that parse `.jsonl` session files from `~/.claude/projects/`, identifying both Era 1 (`[Old tool result content cleared]`) and Era 2 (`<persisted-output>`) phantom read indicators.\n\n**Documentation**: README.md serves as the public-facing explanation; PRD.md and related docs/ files serve internal development purposes.\n\n## Design Principles\n\n### Separation of Concerns\n\nThis repository serves dual purposes:\n1. **Public experiment**: Materials for end-users to reproduce the issue\n2. **Development infrastructure**: WSD framework for building the experiment\n\nThese concerns are kept separate:\n- User-facing materials (README, analysis scripts) contain no references to internal development processes\n- Internal documents (PRD, Action Plan) may reference development methodology freely\n- The WSD infrastructure enables development but also serves as part of the reproduction trigger\n\n### Hawthorne Effect Consideration\n\nA noted concern is whether a User Agent operating in a project explicitly dedicated to detecting phantom reads might behave differently (be less likely to exhibit phantom reads). This is documented as a concern to investigate if reproduction results differ significantly from the original investigation. The working hypothesis is that the bug is at the harness/infrastructure level, not influenced by project content.\n\n### Minimal Viable Reproduction\n\nThe initial approach uses the existing WSD documentation as the multi-file read trigger. If this proves insufficient to reliably trigger phantom reads, the design allows for adding a \"dummy project\" (simple CLI tool or similar) to provide additional file complexity.\n\n## Success Metrics\n\nThis project achieves its goals when:\n\n1. **Documented**: README clearly explains the Phantom Reads phenomenon and links to the official issue\n\n2. **Reproducible**: End-users can follow the instructions to trigger phantom reads on affected Claude Code versions\n\n3. **Verifiable**: Analysis tools can programmatically detect phantom reads in session logs, providing objective evidence beyond AI self-reporting\n\n4. **Accessible**: Instructions are clear enough for users unfamiliar with WSD to execute the reproduction experiment\n\n## Future Direction\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n\nIf the core reproduction is successful, future work might include:\n\n1. **Minimal reproduction case**: Identifying the smallest set of conditions that reliably triggers phantom reads\n2. **Automated trial runner**: Scripts that execute multiple trials and aggregate statistics\n3. **Real-time monitoring**: Tools that detect phantom reads during active sessions\n4. **Mitigation strategies**: Workarounds users can employ while the bug remains unfixed\n\n### Out of Scope\n\nThis project explicitly does not aim to:\n- Fix the bug (that responsibility lies with Anthropic)\n- Provide production-grade tooling\n- Support all possible Claude Code configurations\n- Guarantee reproduction (the bug is intermittent by nature)\n\n## References\n\n- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/17407\n- Claude Code Documentation: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code\n- Opus 4.5 Release: 2025-11-24\n","numLines":239,"startLine":1,"totalLines":239}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"6b3312d8-78b6-4c09-ae51-089ef9200df6"}

I am the Project-Bootstrapper, and my role is to ensure you understand all rules, standards, and conventions before you begin work. This will prevent your work from being rejected by Special Agents during the QA phase.\n\n## CRITICAL: Mandatory Reading Requirements\n\nBefore you proceed with ANY work, you MUST read the following files in their entirety. DO NOT skip any of these files. DO NOT assume you already know what's in them.\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation Documents (READ FIRST)\n\n1. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`**\n   - THE INVIOLABLE LAWS. Breaking ANY rule here results in COMPLETE REJECTION of your work.\n   - This is not negotiable. Every rule must be followed exactly.\n\n2. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`**\n   - Project-specific design philosophies\n   - Currently minimal, but must be consulted\n\n### Phase 2: Task-Specific Standards (READ SECOND)\n\nSince you'll be working in a Python codebase:\n\n3. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`**\n   - General coding guidelines that apply to ALL code you write\n\n4. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`**\n   - Python-specific requirements including type hints, tools, and conventions\n\n5. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`**\n   - Critical if your work involves ANY code changes (specs must stay in sync)\n\n### Phase 3: Additional Standards (READ IF APPLICABLE)\n\nBased on your specific workscope, you may also need:\n\n- **For testing work**: `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- **For configuration work**: `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Environment-and-Config-Variable-Standards.md`\n- **For data structures**: `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Data-Structure-Documentation-Standards.md`\n\n---\n\n## THE THREE MOST VIOLATED RULES (MEMORIZE THESE)\n\nBased on historical data, these violations cause the most rejections:\n\n### 1. Rule 5.1 - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (MOST FREQUENTLY VIOLATED)\n\n**THE RULE:**\n> \"THIS APP HAS NOT SHIPPED YET. When we make a change, please do not include migration-based solutions or be concerned with maintaining 'backward compatibility' or 'legacy support.' DO NOT BE CONCERNED WITH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.\"\n\n**WHY IT'S VIOLATED:**\nUser Agents instinctively try to be \"helpful\" by preserving old code paths or adding migration notes.\n\n**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:**\n- No migration code\n- No \"legacy support\" comments\n- No \"for backward compatibility\" logic\n- Treat every change as if the new design was always the design\n\n**RULE-ENFORCER WILL REJECT YOUR ENTIRE SUBMISSION** if you violate this rule.\n\n### 2. Rule 3.4 - NO META-PROCESS REFERENCES IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS\n\n**THE RULE:**\nProduct artifacts (source code, tests, scripts) must NEVER contain phase numbers, task IDs, or development planning references.\n\n**FORBIDDEN EXAMPLES:**\n```python\n# ❌ Extracted from cli.py during Phase 2 refactoring\n# ❌ Logs warnings for malformed tags (task 2.5.4)\n# ❌ \"\"\"Test for Phase 3 authentication feature\"\"\"\n# ❌ // Fixed null pointer (see ticket #47)\n```\n\n**CORRECT EXAMPLES:**\n```python\n# ✅ Validates malformed tag warnings\n# ✅ \"\"\"Test tag validation error messages\"\"\"\n```\n\n**WHY IT MATTERS:**\nPhase numbers and task IDs are ephemeral planning details. They have no meaning in the shipped product.\n\n### 3. Rule 3.11 - BLOCKED WRITE ACCESS SOLUTION\n\n**THE RULE:**\nIf you get a write access error for a file in a read-only directory:\n1. Copy the file to `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/workbench/` with EXACT same filename\n2. Edit the copy directly as if editing the original\n3. Inform the User you've created an edited version in workbench\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- Ask the User \"what should I do?\"\n- Try to change file permissions\n- Skip the edit\n- Create a differently-named file\n\n---\n\n## Project-Specific Context: Phantom Reads Investigation\n\nThis is NOT a typical software product. This is an **investigation repository** for reproducing Claude Code Issue #17407.\n\n**Project Purpose:**\n- Document the Phantom Reads bug (Claude believes it read files when it didn't)\n- Provide reproduction environment\n- Build analysis tools\n\n**Key Project Files:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md` - Ongoing investigation notes\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/README.md` - Project overview and bug description\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/WORKAROUND.md` - MCP-based mitigation\n\n**Unique Consideration:**\nThis project investigates a bug in the very tools you're using. Be especially mindful of file read operations and verify you've actually received file contents.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Python Standards Summary\n\nSince this is a Python project, here are the non-negotiable requirements:\n\n1. **Type hints are MANDATORY**\n   - All functions must have explicit return types (`-> None`, `-> str`, etc.)\n   - Type parameters must be lowercase (`list[int]` NOT `List[int]`)\n   - NEVER import `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple` from typing\n\n2. **Documentation is MANDATORY**\n   - All public functions and classes need docstrings\n   - Use Google-style with `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`\n   - Test methods must document ALL parameters including pytest fixtures\n\n3. **Tools and Environment**\n   - Use `uv` for dependency management (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest`)\n   - Use `ruff` for linting and formatting\n   - Use `mypy` for type checking\n   - Use `pytest` for testing\n   - Activate venv with `pyactivate` from project root\n\n4. **Code Quality**\n   - Use f-strings for string formatting\n   - Prefer `Path.open()` over `open()`\n   - 4 spaces for indentation\n   - Follow PEP 8\n\n---\n\n## Working with the QA Agents (Your Gatekeepers)\n\nDuring `/wsd:execute`, four Special Agents have **VETO POWER** over your work:\n\n### 1. Documentation-Steward\n**Will reject if:** Your code doesn't match specifications\n**To pass:** Keep specs in sync with code changes (Rule 3.5)\n\n### 2. Rule-Enforcer\n**Will reject if:** You violate ANY rule in Agent-Rules.md\n**To pass:** Follow every rule exactly, especially Rules 5.1, 3.4, and 2.x\n\n### 3. Test-Guardian\n**Will reject if:** Tests fail or coverage is inadequate\n**To pass:** Write tests for new functionality, ensure all tests pass\n\n### 4. Health-Inspector\n**Will reject if:** Lint, type, format, or security checks fail\n**To pass:** Run `./wsd.py health` before submitting\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If a QA agent's report lacks proper evidence (test output, health check table), you MUST reject their approval and demand they re-run with proof.\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Defensive Programming Excess**\n   - Don't add redundant fallbacks for internal state (Rule 1.5, 3.7)\n   - Trust documented guarantees from authoritative components\n\n2. **Specification Drift**\n   - If you change code, update the spec in the SAME workscope (Rule 3.5)\n   - Discrepancies must be escalated to User, not silently resolved\n\n3. **Terminal Command File Writing**\n   - NEVER use `cat >>`, `echo >>`, `<< EOF`, `> file`, `>> file` (Rule 4.4)\n   - Use your standard Read/Edit tools instead\n\n4. **Git State Modification**\n   - Only read-only git commands allowed (Rule 2.2)\n   - No stash, add, commit, checkout, etc.\n\n5. **Forbidden Directory Edits**\n   - Never edit files in `docs/read-only/`, `docs/references/`, `dev/template/` (Rule 2.1)\n   - Use the workbench copy solution (Rule 3.11) if write-blocked\n\n6. **Ignoring Warnings**\n   - Own ALL warnings your work introduces (Rule 4.7)\n   - \"Non-blocking\" doesn't mean \"ignorable\"\n\n7. **Silencing Issues**\n   - You are the User's eyes and ears (Rule 3.16)\n   - Report ALL discoveries to the User, even if not your workscope\n\n---\n\n## Special Considerations for `[%]` Tasks\n\nIf your workscope contains tasks marked `[%]`, understand this:\n\n**`[%]` means:** Work may exist but is INCOMPLETE or UNVERIFIED\n\n**Your responsibility:**\n- Treat `[%]` EXACTLY as you would treat `[ ]`\n- You have FULL implementation responsibility\n- Don't assume existing code is correct\n- Find the \"delta\" between current state and specification\n- Implement that delta\n\n**Common failure mode:**\n- Agent sees existing code, assumes it's done, skips verification, misses critical gaps\n\n**Correct approach:**\n- Work through the task as if implementing from scratch\n- Compare against existing implementation at each step\n- If 0% exists: implement everything\n- If 90% exists: find and implement the missing 10%\n- If 100% exists and matches spec: confirm it (rare)\n\n---\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\n**BEFORE you receive your custom workscope from the User:**\n\n1. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` in its entirety\n2. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`\n3. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`\n4. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`\n5. ✅ Review `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`\n\n**AFTER reading all mandatory files:**\n\n6. ✅ **HALT and check in with the User** before continuing\n7. ✅ Confirm you've read all required materials\n8. ✅ Wait for User to provide your custom workscope assignment\n\n**DO NOT proceed to execution until:**\n- You've read all required files\n- You've checked in with the User\n- You've received your specific workscope from the User\n\n---\n\n## Final Warnings\n\n1. **Read the rules.** All of them. Completely. The Rules-Enforcer will reject your work instantly for violations.\n\n2. **Rule 5.1 is your nemesis.** You will be tempted to add backward compatibility. DON'T.\n\n3. **Rule 3.4 will haunt you.** Check every comment and docstring for meta-process references before submitting.\n\n4. **Proof of work matters.** Reject QA approvals that lack proper evidence.\n\n5. **You are the User's eyes.** Report everything you discover, even if it's not in your workscope.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgment Required\n\nBefore proceeding, you must:\n\n1. Confirm you will read all mandatory files before beginning work\n2. Acknowledge understanding of Rules 5.1, 3.4, and 3.11\n3. Confirm you will HALT and check with the User after reading required materials\n4. Acknowledge that you will wait for the User to provide your custom workscope\n\n**Your work begins AFTER you've completed the mandatory reading and checked in with the User.**\n\nGood luck, and welcome to the team."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a595a8c (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"uuid":"d3beec53-c461-403e-a8d1-85046afb08b6","timestamp":"2026-01-15T23:59:22.980Z","toolUseResult":{"status":"completed","prompt":"I am a User Agent that has been initialized with `/wsd:init --custom` and am going through onboarding.

Let me provide you with comprehensive onboarding guidance.\n\n---\n\n# User Agent Onboarding for Workscope 20260115-155448\n\nWelcome to the **Phantom Reads Investigation** project. I am the Project-Bootstrapper, and my role is to ensure you understand all rules, standards, and conventions before you begin work. This will prevent your work from being rejected by Special Agents during the QA phase.\n\n## CRITICAL: Mandatory Reading Requirements\n\nBefore you proceed with ANY work, you MUST read the following files in their entirety. DO NOT skip any of these files. DO NOT assume you already know what's in them.\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation Documents (READ FIRST)\n\n1. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md`**\n   - THE INVIOLABLE LAWS. Breaking ANY rule here results in COMPLETE REJECTION of your work.\n   - This is not negotiable. Every rule must be followed exactly.\n\n2. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`**\n   - Project-specific design philosophies\n   - Currently minimal, but must be consulted\n\n### Phase 2: Task-Specific Standards (READ SECOND)\n\nSince you'll be working in a Python codebase:\n\n3. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`**\n   - General coding guidelines that apply to ALL code you write\n\n4. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`**\n   - Python-specific requirements including type hints, tools, and conventions\n\n5. **`/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`**\n   - Critical if your work involves ANY code changes (specs must stay in sync)\n\n### Phase 3: Additional Standards (READ IF APPLICABLE)\n\nBased on your specific workscope, you may also need:\n\n- **For testing work**: `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Test-Environment-Isolation-Standards.md`\n- **For configuration work**: `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Environment-and-Config-Variable-Standards.md`\n- **For data structures**: `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Data-Structure-Documentation-Standards.md`\n\n---\n\n## THE THREE MOST VIOLATED RULES (MEMORIZE THESE)\n\nBased on historical data, these violations cause the most rejections:\n\n### 1. Rule 5.1 - NO BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY (MOST FREQUENTLY VIOLATED)\n\n**THE RULE:**\n> \"THIS APP HAS NOT SHIPPED YET. When we make a change, please do not include migration-based solutions or be concerned with maintaining 'backward compatibility' or 'legacy support.' DO NOT BE CONCERNED WITH BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY.\"\n\n**WHY IT'S VIOLATED:**\nUser Agents instinctively try to be \"helpful\" by preserving old code paths or adding migration notes.\n\n**WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU:**\n- No migration code\n- No \"legacy support\" comments\n- No \"for backward compatibility\" logic\n- Treat every change as if the new design was always the design\n\n**RULE-ENFORCER WILL REJECT YOUR ENTIRE SUBMISSION** if you violate this rule.\n\n### 2. Rule 3.4 - NO META-PROCESS REFERENCES IN PRODUCT ARTIFACTS\n\n**THE RULE:**\nProduct artifacts (source code, tests, scripts) must NEVER contain phase numbers, task IDs, or development planning references.\n\n**FORBIDDEN EXAMPLES:**\n```python\n# ❌ Extracted from cli.py during Phase 2 refactoring\n# ❌ Logs warnings for malformed tags (task 2.5.4)\n# ❌ \"\"\"Test for Phase 3 authentication feature\"\"\"\n# ❌ // Fixed null pointer (see ticket #47)\n```\n\n**CORRECT EXAMPLES:**\n```python\n# ✅ Validates malformed tag warnings\n# ✅ \"\"\"Test tag validation error messages\"\"\"\n```\n\n**WHY IT MATTERS:**\nPhase numbers and task IDs are ephemeral planning details. They have no meaning in the shipped product.\n\n### 3. Rule 3.11 - BLOCKED WRITE ACCESS SOLUTION\n\n**THE RULE:**\nIf you get a write access error for a file in a read-only directory:\n1. Copy the file to `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/workbench/` with EXACT same filename\n2. Edit the copy directly as if editing the original\n3. Inform the User you've created an edited version in workbench\n\n**DO NOT:**\n- Ask the User \"what should I do?\"\n- Try to change file permissions\n- Skip the edit\n- Create a differently-named file\n\n---\n\n## Project-Specific Context: Phantom Reads Investigation\n\nThis is NOT a typical software product. This is an **investigation repository** for reproducing Claude Code Issue #17407.\n\n**Project Purpose:**\n- Document the Phantom Reads bug (Claude believes it read files when it didn't)\n- Provide reproduction environment\n- Build analysis tools\n\n**Key Project Files:**\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md` - Ongoing investigation notes\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/README.md` - Project overview and bug description\n- `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/WORKAROUND.md` - MCP-based mitigation\n\n**Unique Consideration:**\nThis project investigates a bug in the very tools you're using. Be especially mindful of file read operations and verify you've actually received file contents.\n\n---\n\n## Critical Python Standards Summary\n\nSince this is a Python project, here are the non-negotiable requirements:\n\n1. **Type hints are MANDATORY**\n   - All functions must have explicit return types (`-> None`, `-> str`, etc.)\n   - Type parameters must be lowercase (`list[int]` NOT `List[int]`)\n   - NEVER import `List`, `Dict`, `Tuple` from typing\n\n2. **Documentation is MANDATORY**\n   - All public functions and classes need docstrings\n   - Use Google-style with `Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`\n   - Test methods must document ALL parameters including pytest fixtures\n\n3. **Tools and Environment**\n   - Use `uv` for dependency management (`uv sync`, `uv run pytest`)\n   - Use `ruff` for linting and formatting\n   - Use `mypy` for type checking\n   - Use `pytest` for testing\n   - Activate venv with `pyactivate` from project root\n\n4. **Code Quality**\n   - Use f-strings for string formatting\n   - Prefer `Path.open()` over `open()`\n   - 4 spaces for indentation\n   - Follow PEP 8\n\n---\n\n## Working with the QA Agents (Your Gatekeepers)\n\nDuring `/wsd:execute`, four Special Agents have **VETO POWER** over your work:\n\n### 1. Documentation-Steward\n**Will reject if:** Your code doesn't match specifications\n**To pass:** Keep specs in sync with code changes (Rule 3.5)\n\n### 2. Rule-Enforcer\n**Will reject if:** You violate ANY rule in Agent-Rules.md\n**To pass:** Follow every rule exactly, especially Rules 5.1, 3.4, and 2.x\n\n### 3. Test-Guardian\n**Will reject if:** Tests fail or coverage is inadequate\n**To pass:** Write tests for new functionality, ensure all tests pass\n\n### 4. Health-Inspector\n**Will reject if:** Lint, type, format, or security checks fail\n**To pass:** Run `./wsd.py health` before submitting\n\n**IMPORTANT:** If a QA agent's report lacks proper evidence (test output, health check table), you MUST reject their approval and demand they re-run with proof.\n\n---\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n1. **Defensive Programming Excess**\n   - Don't add redundant fallbacks for internal state (Rule 1.5, 3.7)\n   - Trust documented guarantees from authoritative components\n\n2. **Specification Drift**\n   - If you change code, update the spec in the SAME workscope (Rule 3.5)\n   - Discrepancies must be escalated to User, not silently resolved\n\n3. **Terminal Command File Writing**\n   - NEVER use `cat >>`, `echo >>`, `<< EOF`, `> file`, `>> file` (Rule 4.4)\n   - Use your standard Read/Edit tools instead\n\n4. **Git State Modification**\n   - Only read-only git commands allowed (Rule 2.2)\n   - No stash, add, commit, checkout, etc.\n\n5. **Forbidden Directory Edits**\n   - Never edit files in `docs/read-only/`, `docs/references/`, `dev/template/` (Rule 2.1)\n   - Use the workbench copy solution (Rule 3.11) if write-blocked\n\n6. **Ignoring Warnings**\n   - Own ALL warnings your work introduces (Rule 4.7)\n   - \"Non-blocking\" doesn't mean \"ignorable\"\n\n7. **Silencing Issues**\n   - You are the User's eyes and ears (Rule 3.16)\n   - Report ALL discoveries to the User, even if not your workscope\n\n---\n\n## Special Considerations for `[%]` Tasks\n\nIf your workscope contains tasks marked `[%]`, understand this:\n\n**`[%]` means:** Work may exist but is INCOMPLETE or UNVERIFIED\n\n**Your responsibility:**\n- Treat `[%]` EXACTLY as you would treat `[ ]`\n- You have FULL implementation responsibility\n- Don't assume existing code is correct\n- Find the \"delta\" between current state and specification\n- Implement that delta\n\n**Common failure mode:**\n- Agent sees existing code, assumes it's done, skips verification, misses critical gaps\n\n**Correct approach:**\n- Work through the task as if implementing from scratch\n- Compare against existing implementation at each step\n- If 0% exists: implement everything\n- If 90% exists: find and implement the missing 10%\n- If 100% exists and matches spec: confirm it (rare)\n\n---\n\n## Your Next Steps\n\n**BEFORE you receive your custom workscope from the User:**\n\n1. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/Agent-Rules.md` in its entirety\n2. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md`\n3. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md`\n4. ✅ Read `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md`\n5. ✅ Review `/Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/docs/core/Design-Decisions.md`\n\n**AFTER reading all mandatory files:**\n\n6. ✅ **HALT and check in with the User** before continuing\n7. ✅ Confirm you've read all required materials\n8. ✅ Wait for User to provide your custom workscope assignment\n\n**DO NOT proceed to execution until:**\n- You've read all required files\n- You've checked in with the User\n- You've received your specific workscope from the User\n\n---\n\n## Final Warnings\n\n1. **Read the rules.** All of them. Completely. The Rules-Enforcer will reject your work instantly for violations.\n\n2. **Rule 5.1 is your nemesis.** You will be tempted to add backward compatibility. DON'T.\n\n3. **Rule 3.4 will haunt you.** Check every comment and docstring for meta-process references before submitting.\n\n4. **Proof of work matters.** Reject QA approvals that lack proper evidence.\n\n5. **You are the User's eyes.** Report everything you discover, even if it's not in your workscope.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgment Required\n\nBefore proceeding, you must:\n\n1. Confirm you will read all mandatory files before beginning work\n2. Acknowledge understanding of Rules 5.1, 3.4, and 3.11\n3. Confirm you will HALT and check with the User after reading required materials\n4. Acknowledge that you will wait for the User to provide your custom workscope\n\n**Your work begins AFTER you've completed the mandatory reading and checked in with the User.**\n\nGood luck, and welcome to the team."}],"totalDurationMs":99183,"totalTokens":48844,"totalToolUseCount":15,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1901,"cache_read_input_tokens":43872,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1901,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3065,"service_tier":"standard"}},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"de088500-19db-4b0a-b8be-139b8c2994d4"}

An agent adds a configuration option but doesn't document it. Users and future developers cannot discover the option exists.\n    14→\n    15→**Dead Documentation**: Specifications describe features not present in code. An agent removes a CLI flag but leaves it documented.

Common files: `Config-Spec.md`, `Configuration.md`, `Settings-Reference.md`. Updated when configuration schemas, defaults, or loading logic changes.\n   134→\n   135→**Environment Variable Specifications** document environment variables affecting behavior. Common files: `Environment-Variables-Spec.md`, `Environment.md`, `Env-Vars.md`. Updated when code reads new environment variables or changes variable interpretation.\n   136→\n   137→**CLI Command Specifications** document command-line interfaces. Common files: `CLI-Commands-Spec.md`, `CLI-Reference.md`, `Command-Line-Interface.md`. Updated when CLI parsers define new flags or modify command behavior.\n   138→\n   139→**API Specifications** document HTTP endpoints. Common files: `API-Spec.md`, `API-Reference.md`, `Endpoints.md`. Updated when routes change or request/response schemas modify.\n   140→\n   141→Projects may maintain additional specifications for database schemas, event formats, plugin interfaces, or data structures. Apply the same synchronization principles.\n   142→\n   143→## Specification Update Process\n   144→\n   145→### 1. Identify Affected Specifications\n   146→\n   147→Before implementing code changes, determine which specifications will require updates. Ask:\n   148→\n   149→- Am I modifying configuration schema or defaults? → Configuration specification\n   150→- Am I adding environment variable reads? → Environment variable specification\n   151→- Am I adding or changing CLI flags? → CLI specification\n   152→- Am I adding or modifying API endpoints? → API specification\n   153→\n   154→Multiple specifications may require updates for a single feature. A configuration option often has a corresponding CLI flag and environment variable override—all three specifications need updates.\n   155→\n   156→### 2. Implement Code Changes\n   157→\n   158→Complete the workscope tasks. Track:\n   159→- New configuration options and their defaults\n   160→- New environment variables and their purposes\n   161→- New CLI flags or API endpoints and their behaviors\n   162→- Removed or renamed options\n   163→\n   164→### 3. Update Specifications\n   165→\n   166→For each affected specification:\n   167→\n   168→**Read the specification** to understand its structure and formatting. Match existing patterns.\n   169→\n   170→**Locate the appropriate section** for your change. Configuration options are typically grouped by category. Environment variables by purpose. CLI flags by command.\n   171→\n   172→**Add, modify, or remove documentation** matching your code changes. Use consistent formatting with existing entries.\n   173→\n   174→**Include concrete examples** showing actual usage. Examples should be executable code snippets or command-line invocations that users can copy.\n   175→\n   176→**Update cross-references** if option names changed. Configuration options referenced from environment variable sections need consistency.\n   177→\n   178→\n   179→\n   180→### 4. Verify Synchronization\n   181→\n   182→After updating code and specifications, verify accuracy:\n   183→\n   184→**Manual verification**:\n   185→- Review each documented feature against implementation\n   186→- Test that examples actually work\n   187→- Confirm all new features are documented\n   188→- Verify removed features are removed from specifications\n   189→\n   190→**Automated verification** (if project implements drift detection):\n   191→- Run the project's specification drift audit tool\n   192→- Address any reported missing documentation (code exists, spec doesn't)\n   193→- Address any reported dead documentation (spec exists, code doesn't)\n   194→- Re-run until verification passes\n   195→\n   196→Some projects implement automated drift detection scripts that parse specifications and code to identify discrepancies. These tools report missing documentation and dead documentation systematically. If available, use them. If not, rely on careful manual review.\n   197→\n   198→## Language-Specific Documentation Patterns\n   199→\n   200→### Python Projects\n   201→\n   202→Configuration options typically use snake_case and are often nested dictionaries:\n   203→\n   204→```markdown\n   205→### cache.max_size\n   206→\n   207→**Type**: `int`\n   208→**Default**: `1000`\n   209→\n   210→Maximum entries in cache. Oldest entries evicted when limit reached.\n   211→\n   212→**Example**:\n   213→```python\n   214→config = {\n   215→    \"cache\": {\n   216→        \"max_size\": 500\n   217→    }\n   218→}\n   219→```\n   220→```\n   221→\n   222→Environment variables follow uppercase snake_case conventions:\n   223→```markdown\n   224→### APP_CACHE_DIR\n   225→\n   226→**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n   227→**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n   228→\n   229→Directory for cache files. Must have write permissions.\n   230→\n   231→**Example**:\n   232→```bash\n   233→export APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n   234→```\n   235→```\n   236→\n   237→### TypeScript Projects\n   238→\n   239→Configuration options typically use camelCase and are interface-typed:\n   240→\n   241→```markdown\n   242→### cache.maxSize\n   243→\n   244→**Type**: `number`\n   245→**Default**: `1000`\n   246→\n   247→Maximum entries in cache.

Maintain synchronization as you work rather than batch updates at the end.\n   288→\n   289→### Before Completion\n   290→\n   291→Verify all specifications are synchronized:\n   292→- Check that every code change has corresponding documentation\n   293→- Run drift detection if available\n   294→- Document specification updates in Work Journal\n   295→\n   296→Workscopes involving code changes are incomplete until specifications are updated. Documentation-Steward agents may review specification synchronization during quality assurance.\n   297→\n   298→## Definition of Done\n   299→\n   300→A workscope with code changes is complete only when:\n   301→\n   302→1. Code changes are implemented and tested\n   303→2. All affected specifications are updated\n   304→3. Specifications accurately describe implementation\n   305→4. Drift verification passes (manual or automated)\n   306→5. Work Journal documents specification changes\n   307→\n   308→Attempting to complete a workscope without specification updates violates Agent Rule 3.11 and will result in workscope rejection.\n   309→\n   310→## Common Pitfalls\n   311→\n   312→### Forgetting Specifications Exist\n   313→\n   314→Agents implement features but forget specification documents need updates.\n   315→\n   316→**Solution**: Review specification requirements during workscope planning. Include specification tasks in execution plan before beginning implementation.\n   317→\n   318→### Partial Updates\n   319→\n   320→Agents update one specification but miss related specifications. Adding a configuration option controlled by a CLI flag requires updating both configuration and CLI specifications.\n   321→\n   322→**Solution**: Map features to all affected specifications. Configuration options often have CLI flag overrides and environment variable overrides. Update all three.\n   323→\n   324→### Migration Notes in Specifications\n   325→\n   326→**Solution**: Write specifications as if features always worked the current way. No migration notes, no old behavior references. For pre-release projects, the new design is the only design.\n   327→\n   328→### Drift After Updates\n   329→\n   330→Specifications updated but drift detection still reports issues.\n   331→\n   332→**Solution**: Verify exact names match between spec and code. Check for typos. Ensure code actually uses documented features. Confirm specification formatting matches project patterns.\n   333→\n   334→### Mismatched Structure\n   335→\n   336→Specifications organized differently from code makes alignment difficult.\n   337→\n   338→**Solution**: Mirror code organization in specifications where practical. Group related configuration options as they appear in code.

When code changes but specifications don't, \"specification drift\" occurs—documentation misleads developers and users about actual behavior. Agent Rule 3.11 requires specification updates in the same workscope as code changes.\n\n## Specification Drift\n\nDrift manifests in three forms:\n\n**Missing Documentation**: Code implements features not documented in specifications. An agent adds a configuration option but doesn't document it. Users and future developers cannot discover the option exists.\n\n**Dead Documentation**: Specifications describe features not present in code. An agent removes a CLI flag but leaves it documented. Users attempt to use non-existent features.\n\n**Inconsistent Documentation**: Code and specifications both exist but describe different behavior. An agent changes a default value in code but doesn't update the documented default. Users expect incorrect behavior.\n\nAll three forms undermine specification trustworthiness and must be prevented through systematic maintenance.\n\n## When Specifications Require Updates\n\n### Configuration Changes\n\nConfiguration specifications document available configuration options, their types, defaults, and behavior. Update these specifications when:\n\n- Adding a configuration option with its schema and default value\n- Removing a configuration option\n- Changing an option's name, type, or default value\n- Modifying how an option affects application behavior\n- Adding or removing validation rules\n\n**Recognition Patterns:**\n\nIn Python projects, watch for changes to default configuration dictionaries, dataclass definitions, or schema validators:\n```python\n# Changes requiring specification updates\ndef get_default_config():\n    return {\n        \"cache\": {\n            \"max_size\": 1000,  # New option or changed default\n            \"ttl_seconds\": 3600  # New option\n        }\n    }\n```\n\nIn TypeScript projects, watch for changes to configuration interfaces, default objects, or validation schemas:\n```typescript\n// Changes requiring specification updates\ninterface Config {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: number;  // New property or type change\n    ttlSeconds: number;  // New property\n  }\n}\n\nconst defaultConfig: Config = {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: 1000,  // Changed default\n    ttlSeconds: 3600  // New default\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Environment Variable Changes\n\nEnvironment variable specifications document variables affecting application behavior, their purposes, and precedence. Update these specifications when:\n\n- Adding code that reads a new environment variable\n- Removing code that reads an environment variable\n- Changing how an environment variable is interpreted\n- Modifying environment variable precedence or fallback logic\n\n**Recognition Patterns:**\n\nIn Python projects, watch for `os.environ`, `os.getenv`, or environment management utilities:\n```python\n# Changes requiring specification updates\ncache_dir = os.getenv(\"APP_CACHE_DIR\", \"/tmp/cache\")  # New variable\napi_key = os.environ[\"API_KEY\"]  # New required variable\n```\n\nIn TypeScript projects, watch for `process.env` accesses or environment parsers:\n```typescript\n// Changes requiring specification updates\nconst cacheDir = process.env.APP_CACHE_DIR ?? \"/tmp/cache\";  // New variable\nconst apiKey = process.env.API_KEY!;  // New required variable\n```\n\n### Command Interface Changes\n\nCommand interface specifications document CLI commands, flags, options, or API endpoints. Update these specifications when:\n\n- Adding a command-line flag, API endpoint, or interactive command\n- Removing a command-line flag or endpoint\n- Changing a flag's name, aliases, type, or behavior\n- Modifying command behavior or output format\n- Changing API request/response schemas\n\n**Recognition Patterns:**\n\nIn CLI applications (Python with argparse/click/typer, Node with commander/yargs):\n```python\n# Python CLI - changes requiring specification updates\n@click.option(\"--format\", type=click.Choice([\"json\", \"yaml\"]))  # New flag\n@click.option(\"--cache-dir\", help=\"Cache directory\")  # New flag\n```\n\n```typescript\n// TypeScript CLI - changes requiring specification updates\nprogram\n  .option(\"--format <type>\", \"output format\", \"json\")  // New flag\n  .option(\"--cache-dir <path>\", \"cache directory\");  // New flag\n```\n\nIn API applications, watch for new routes, changed endpoints, or modified schemas:\n```python\n# Flask/FastAPI - changes requiring specification updates\n@app.post(\"/api/users\")  # New endpoint\ndef create_user(user: UserCreate):  # New schema\n```\n\n```typescript\n// Express/Fastify - changes requiring specification updates\napp.post(\"/api/users\", handler);  // New endpoint\ninterface UserCreate { ... }  // New schema\n```\n\n## Common Specification Documents\n\nRecognize these specification patterns across projects:\n\n**Configuration Specifications** document config file options. Common files: `Config-Spec.md`, `Configuration.md`, `Settings-Reference.md`. Updated when configuration schemas, defaults, or loading logic changes.\n\n**Environment Variable Specifications** document environment variables affecting behavior. Common files: `Environment-Variables-Spec.md`, `Environment.md`, `Env-Vars.md`. Updated when code reads new environment variables or changes variable interpretation.\n\n**CLI Command Specifications** document command-line interfaces. Common files: `CLI-Commands-Spec.md`, `CLI-Reference.md`, `Command-Line-Interface.md`. Updated when CLI parsers define new flags or modify command behavior.\n\n**API Specifications** document HTTP endpoints. Common files: `API-Spec.md`, `API-Reference.md`, `Endpoints.md`. Updated when routes change or request/response schemas modify.\n\nProjects may maintain additional specifications for database schemas, event formats, plugin interfaces, or data structures. Apply the same synchronization principles.\n\n## Specification Update Process\n\n### 1. Identify Affected Specifications\n\nBefore implementing code changes, determine which specifications will require updates. Ask:\n\n- Am I modifying configuration schema or defaults? → Configuration specification\n- Am I adding environment variable reads? → Environment variable specification\n- Am I adding or changing CLI flags? → CLI specification\n- Am I adding or modifying API endpoints? → API specification\n\nMultiple specifications may require updates for a single feature. A configuration option often has a corresponding CLI flag and environment variable override—all three specifications need updates.\n\n### 2. Implement Code Changes\n\nComplete the workscope tasks. Track:\n- New configuration options and their defaults\n- New environment variables and their purposes\n- New CLI flags or API endpoints and their behaviors\n- Removed or renamed options\n\n### 3. Update Specifications\n\nFor each affected specification:\n\n**Read the specification** to understand its structure and formatting. Match existing patterns.\n\n**Locate the appropriate section** for your change. Configuration options are typically grouped by category. Environment variables by purpose. CLI flags by command.\n\n**Add, modify, or remove documentation** matching your code changes. Use consistent formatting with existing entries.\n\n**Include concrete examples** showing actual usage. Examples should be executable code snippets or command-line invocations that users can copy.\n\n**Update cross-references** if option names changed. Configuration options referenced from environment variable sections need consistency.\n\n\n\n### 4. Verify Synchronization\n\nAfter updating code and specifications, verify accuracy:\n\n**Manual verification**:\n- Review each documented feature against implementation\n- Test that examples actually work\n- Confirm all new features are documented\n- Verify removed features are removed from specifications\n\n**Automated verification** (if project implements drift detection):\n- Run the project's specification drift audit tool\n- Address any reported missing documentation (code exists, spec doesn't)\n- Address any reported dead documentation (spec exists, code doesn't)\n- Re-run until verification passes\n\nSome projects implement automated drift detection scripts that parse specifications and code to identify discrepancies. These tools report missing documentation and dead documentation systematically. If available, use them. If not, rely on careful manual review.\n\n## Language-Specific Documentation Patterns\n\n### Python Projects\n\nConfiguration options typically use snake_case and are often nested dictionaries:\n\n```markdown\n### cache.max_size\n\n**Type**: `int`\n**Default**: `1000`\n\nMaximum entries in cache. Oldest entries evicted when limit reached.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nconfig = {\n    \"cache\": {\n        \"max_size\": 500\n    }\n}\n```\n```\n\nEnvironment variables follow uppercase snake_case conventions:\n```markdown\n### APP_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n\nDirectory for cache files. Must have write permissions.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\nexport APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n```\n```\n\n### TypeScript Projects\n\nConfiguration options typically use camelCase and are interface-typed:\n\n```markdown\n### cache.maxSize\n\n**Type**: `number`\n**Default**: `1000`\n\nMaximum entries in cache. Oldest entries evicted when limit reached.\n\n**Example**:\n```typescript\nconst config = {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: 500\n  }\n};\n```\n```\n\nEnvironment variables follow the same uppercase patterns as Python:\n```markdown\n### APP_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n\nDirectory for cache files. Must have write permissions.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\nexport APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n```\n```\n\nUse language-appropriate naming conventions in examples while maintaining universal documentation structure.\n\n## Integration with Development Workflow\n\n### During Planning\n\nWhen assigned a workscope, identify specification update requirements:\n- Review tasks for configuration, environment, or interface changes\n- Note which specifications need updates\n- Include specification updates in execution plan\n\n### During Execution\n\nImplement code first to understand exact behavior, then update specifications immediately. Maintain synchronization as you work rather than batch updates at the end.\n\n### Before Completion\n\nVerify all specifications are synchronized:\n- Check that every code change has corresponding documentation\n- Run drift detection if available\n- Document specification updates in Work Journal\n\nWorkscopes involving code changes are incomplete until specifications are updated. Documentation-Steward agents may review specification synchronization during quality assurance.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\nA workscope with code changes is complete only when:\n\n1. Code changes are implemented and tested\n2. All affected specifications are updated\n3. Specifications accurately describe implementation\n4. Drift verification passes (manual or automated)\n5. Work Journal documents specification changes\n\nAttempting to complete a workscope without specification updates violates Agent Rule 3.11 and will result in workscope rejection.\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n### Forgetting Specifications Exist\n\nAgents implement features but forget specification documents need updates.\n\n**Solution**: Review specification requirements during workscope planning. Include specification tasks in execution plan before beginning implementation.\n\n### Partial Updates\n\nAgents update one specification but miss related specifications. Adding a configuration option controlled by a CLI flag requires updating both configuration and CLI specifications.\n\n**Solution**: Map features to all affected specifications. Configuration options often have CLI flag overrides and environment variable overrides. Update all three.\n\n### Migration Notes in Specifications\n\n**Solution**: Write specifications as if features always worked the current way. No migration notes, no old behavior references. For pre-release projects, the new design is the only design.\n\n### Drift After Updates\n\nSpecifications updated but drift detection still reports issues.\n\n**Solution**: Verify exact names match between spec and code. Check for typos. Ensure code actually uses documented features. Confirm specification formatting matches project patterns.\n\n### Mismatched Structure\n\nSpecifications organized differently from code makes alignment difficult.\n\n**Solution**: Mirror code organization in specifications where practical. Group related configuration options as they appear in code. Cross-reference between specifications when features span multiple specs.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example: Adding Configuration Option\n\n**Task**: Add automatic cache cleanup option.\n\n**Code (Python)**:\n```python\ndef get_default_config():\n    return {\n        \"cache\": {\n            \"max_size\": 1000,\n            \"auto_clean\": True  # NEW\n        }\n    }\n\n# In cache implementation\nif config[\"cache\"][\"auto_clean\"]:\n    self._clean_expired()\n```\n\n**Code (TypeScript)**:\n```typescript\nconst defaultConfig = {\n  cache: {\n    maxSize: 1000,\n    autoClean: true  // NEW\n  }\n};\n\n// In cache implementation\nif (config.cache.autoClean) {\n  this.cleanExpired();\n}\n```\n\n**Specification Update**:\n```markdown\n### cache.auto_clean / cache.autoClean\n\n**Type**: Boolean\n**Default**: `true`\n\nEnable automatic cleanup of expired cache entries. When enabled, cache removes expired entries during read operations. When disabled, expired entries remain until manual cleanup.\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nconfig = {\"cache\": {\"auto_clean\": False}}\n```\n\n```typescript\nconst config = {cache: {autoClean: false}};\n```\n```\n\n### Example: Adding Environment Variable\n\n**Task**: Allow cache directory override via environment.\n\n**Code (Python)**:\n```python\ncache_dir = os.getenv(\"APP_CACHE_DIR\", \"/tmp/cache\")\n```\n\n**Code (TypeScript)**:\n```typescript\nconst cacheDir = process.env.APP_CACHE_DIR ?? \"/tmp/cache\";\n```\n\n**Specification Update**:\n```markdown\n### APP_CACHE_DIR\n\n**Type**: String (filesystem path)\n**Default**: `/tmp/cache`\n\nOverride cache directory location. Must be writable directory. Application creates directory if it doesn't exist.\n\n**Example**:\n```bash\nexport APP_CACHE_DIR=/var/app/cache\n```\n\n**Precedence**: Overrides cache directory from configuration files.\n```\n\n### Example: Removing Feature\n\n**Task**: Remove deprecated legacy mode flag.\n\n**Code Changes**: Delete flag from parser, remove checks from code.\n\n**Specification Update**: Remove entire section documenting the flag.\n\n**Verification**: Confirm no code references remain. Confirm specification no longer mentions removed feature. Run drift detection to verify no dead documentation.\n\n## Related Standards\n\n- Agent Rule 3.11 mandates specification updates with code changes\n- Coding Standards require documentation for all public interfaces\n- Test standards require specification accuracy verification\n\n---\n\n**Key Insight**: Specifications are sources of truth. Code implements what specifications describe. When code changes, specifications must change. Drift undermines trust in documentation and leads to user confusion, developer errors, and wasted time debugging discrepancies.

Then investigate deeply - read related specifications, examine existing code, cross-reference with design decisions and other documentation. Search for inconsistencies, gaps, edge cases, and anything that conflicts with other parts of our system.\n\nYour job is to find what's wrong, what's missing, and what could cause implementation to fail. You own this investigation. Be thorough. Be skeptical. Verify your concerns against actual documents and code before reporting them.\n\nWhen you're ready, share your assessment as a numbered list of findings. We'll discuss them together. Along the way, we might declared numbered \"Investigations\" that need to be performed to guide our decisions. Some issues we may decide should be broken out into separate tickets, and you may be asked to open them (use the `/open-ticket` command).\n\nWhen we agree on all the needed changes for the WPD, you'll update the WPD directly.\n\nAfter updates are complete, remind the user they can run `/refine-plan` again in a fresh session for another pass, repeating until the WPD is solid.\n"}]},"isMeta":true,"uuid":"d3bf5320-f212-4fdc-a975-74f59c555ef9","timestamp":"2026-01-16T00:00:36.915Z"}

The mapping engine supports field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic based on record content or metadata.\n    26→\n    27→**Field Transformation**: Applying transformation operations to individual field values including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformations execute in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent operations.\n    28→\n    29→**Data Enrichment**: Augmenting records with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. The enrichment engine manages cache lifecycle, handles source unavailability gracefully, and tracks enrichment success rates for monitoring.\n    30→\n    31→**Quality Scoring**: Evaluating each record against configurable quality criteria and assigning a numeric score reflecting data completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns.\n    32→\n    33→### Processing Model\n

logic is expressed through declarative rule definitions rather than imperative code, enabling non-developers to understand and modify transformation behavior.\n    63→\n    64→**Idempotent Operations**: All transformations produce identical results when applied to identical inputs, enabling safe retry and replay of failed transformations.\n    65→\n    66→**Preserving Provenance**: The transformation pipeline maintains complete lineage tracking, recording which rules were applied to each field and intermediate values at each stage.\n    67→\n    68→**Graceful Degradation**: When enrichment sources are unavailable or transformation rules encounter unexpected data, the pipeline continues processing with appropriate fallback behavior.\n    69→\n    70→---\n    71→\n    72→## Transformation Pipeline\n    73→\n    74→The transformation pipeline consists of four sequential stages that process records in a defined order.\n    75→\n    76→### Stage 1: Schema Mapping\n    77→\n    78→Schema mapping converts records from Module Alpha's internal format to target schema(s) required by downstream consumers.\n    79→\n    80→**Mapping Operations**:\n    81→\n    82→**Direct Field Mapping**: Copies a source field value to a target field, optionally with type conversion.\n    83→\n    84→**Composite Field Construction**: Combines multiple source fields into a single target field with configurable separators and templates.\n    85→\n    86→**Field Decomposition**: Splits a single source field into multiple target fields using delimiters or patterns.\n    87→\n    88→**Conditional Mapping**: Applies different mapping rules based on source field values or record metadata.\n    89→\n    90→**Default Value Assignment**: Assigns default values when source fields are missing or null.\n    91→\n    92→### Stage 2: Field Transformation\n    93→\n    94→Field transformation applies value-level operations to individual fields after schema mapping.\n    95→\n

[Compliance Requirements](#compliance-requirements)\n\n---\n\n## Overview\n\nModule Beta serves as the data transformation layer of the Data Pipeline System, responsible for converting validated records from Module Alpha into the enriched, normalized format required by Module Gamma for output delivery. As the central processing stage in the pipeline, Module Beta implements comprehensive transformation capabilities including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment, and quality scoring.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Schema Mapping**: Converting records from the internal ingestion format to one or more target output schemas. The mapping engine supports field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic based on record content or metadata.\n\n**Field Transformation**: Applying transformation operations to individual field values including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformations execute in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent operations.\n\n**Data Enrichment**: Augmenting records with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. The enrichment engine manages cache lifecycle, handles source unavailability gracefully, and tracks enrichment success rates for monitoring.\n\n**Quality Scoring**: Evaluating each record against configurable quality criteria and assigning a numeric score reflecting data completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Beta processes records through a multi-stage transformation pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                      MODULE BETA TRANSFORMATION PIPELINE

declarative rule definitions rather than imperative code, enabling non-developers to understand and modify transformation behavior.\n\n**Idempotent Operations**: All transformations produce identical results when applied to identical inputs, enabling safe retry and replay of failed transformations.\n\n**Preserving Provenance**: The transformation pipeline maintains complete lineage tracking, recording which rules were applied to each field and intermediate values at each stage.\n\n**Graceful Degradation**: When enrichment sources are unavailable or transformation rules encounter unexpected data, the pipeline continues processing with appropriate fallback behavior.\n\n---\n\n## Transformation Pipeline\n\nThe transformation pipeline consists of four sequential stages that process records in a defined order.\n\n### Stage 1: Schema Mapping\n\nSchema mapping converts records from Module Alpha's internal format to target schema(s) required by downstream consumers.\n\n**Mapping Operations**:\n\n**Direct Field Mapping**: Copies a source field value to a target field, optionally with type conversion.\n\n**Composite Field Construction**: Combines multiple source fields into a single target field with configurable separators and templates.\n\n**Field Decomposition**: Splits a single source field into multiple target fields using delimiters or patterns.\n\n**Conditional Mapping**: Applies different mapping rules based on source field values or record metadata.\n\n**Default Value Assignment**: Assigns default values when source fields are missing or null.\n\n### Stage 2: Field Transformation\n\nField transformation applies value-level operations to individual fields after schema mapping.\n\n**String Transformations**: Case conversion, trimming, padding, substring extraction, pattern replacement.\n\n**Numeric Transformations**: Arithmetic operations, rounding, scaling, unit conversion.\n\n**Temporal Transformations**: Date/time parsing, formatting, timezone conversion.\n\n**Lookup Transformations**: Value substitution based on lookup tables.\n\n### Stage 3: Data Enrichment\n\nData enrichment augments records with information from external sources including reference databases, external APIs, and cache layers.\n\nWhen an enrichment source is unavailable, the engine applies configured behaviors: FAIL (route to error handling), SKIP (leave empty), DEFAULT (apply defaults), or STALE (use expired cache).\n\n### Stage 4: Quality Scoring\n\nQuality scoring evaluates transformed records and assigns a score between 0.0 and 1.0 based on completeness, consistency, conformance, and timeliness.\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Beta defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### TransformationRequest\n\nRepresents a batch received from Module Alpha:\n\n```\nTransformationRequest:\n  request_id: string            # UUID v4 generated by Module Alpha\n  batch_id: string              # Links to source batch\n  records: list<ValidatedRecord>\n  priority: enum                # NORMAL, HIGH, CRITICAL\n  transformation_profile: string\n```\n\n### IntermediateRecord\n\nRepresents a record during transformation processing:\n\n```\nIntermediateRecord:\n  record_id: string\n  original_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  current_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  stage: enum                   # MAPPING, TRANSFORM, ENRICHMENT, SCORING\n  applied_rules: list<string>\n  transformation_log: list<TransformationLogEntry>\n```\n\n### TransformationLogEntry\n\nCaptures details of a single transformation operation:\n\n```\nTransformationLogEntry:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  rule_id: string\n  field_name: string\n  previous_value: FieldValue\n  new_value: FieldValue\n  operation: string\n```\n\n### TransformedRecord\n\nRepresents a fully transformed record ready for Module Gamma:\n\n```\nTransformedRecord:\n  record_id: string\n  fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  quality_score: float          # 0.0 to 1.0\n  quality_dimensions: QualityDimensions\n  transformation_timestamp: datetime\n  rules_applied: integer\n  lineage_id: string\n```\n\n### QualityDimensions\n\nBreakdown of quality score components:\n\n```\nQualityDimensions:\n  completeness_score: float\n  consistency_score: float\n  conformance_score: float\n  timeliness_score: float\n  overall_score: float\n```\n\n### TransformationFailure\n\nCaptures information about failed records:\n\n```\nTransformationFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  failure_stage: enum\n  failure_rule: string\n  error_code: string\n  error_message: string\n  field_name: string\n  is_recoverable: boolean\n```\n\n---\n\n## Transformation

Quality Rules (Scoring)\n\n---\n\n## Error Handling\n\nModule Beta implements comprehensive error handling following the fail-forward principle: isolate failures, capture context, and continue processing valid records while routing failed records to appropriate error channels.\n\n### Error Categories\n\n#### Mapping Errors\n\nOccur when schema mapping operations fail due to incompatible structures or missing required fields.\n\n**Common Causes**: Missing required source fields, type incompatibility between source and target, invalid mapping configuration, circular field references\n\n**Handling**: Create MappingFailure record with source field state, target schema requirements, and specific mapping rule that failed. Route to mapping error queue. If mapping failure rate exceeds `MAPPING_ERROR_THRESHOLD`, suspend processing and alert operators.\n\n**MappingFailure Structure**:\n```\nMappingFailure:\n  record_id: string\n  source_fields: map<string, FieldValue>\n  target_schema: string\n  failed_mapping: string\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"MAP_001_MISSING_REQUIRED\"\n  error_message: string\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n```\n\n**Metrics**: `beta_mapping_errors_total`, `beta_mapping_error_rate`, `beta_mapping_errors_by_schema`\n\n#### Transformation Errors\n\nOccur when field transformation operations produce invalid results or encounter unexpected input.\n\n**Common Causes**: Regex pattern failures, numeric overflow/underflow, date parsing failures, lookup table misses with FAIL policy, invalid encoding sequences\n\n**Handling**: Log transformation context including input value, rule configuration, and intermediate state. Apply configured fallback:\n- **FAIL**: Route entire record to error queue\n- **SKIP**: Leave field unchanged and continue\n- **DEFAULT**: Apply default value and continue\n- **NULL**: Set field to null and continue\n\n**TransformationError Structure**:\n```\nTransformationError:\n  record_id: string\n  rule_id: string\n  field_name: string\n  input_value: string\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"TRX_003_PATTERN_MISMATCH\"\n  error_message: string\n  intermediate_state: map<string, FieldValue>\n```\n\n**Configuration**: `TRANSFORM_ERROR_POLICY`, `TRANSFORM_MAX_RETRIES`, `TRANSFORM_TIMEOUT_MS`\n\n#### Enrichment Errors\n\nOccur when external data sources are unavailable or return unexpected results.\n\n**Common Causes**: Network connectivity issues, authentication failures, rate limiting, source timeout, malformed response data, lookup key not found\n\n**Transient Errors** (network, timeout): Retry with exponential backoff up to `ENRICHMENT_MAX_RETRIES`. If retries exhausted, apply configured fallback.\n\n**Permanent Errors** (not found, invalid key): Apply fallback immediately without retry.\n\n**Source Degradation**: Track error rates per enrichment source. When error rate exceeds `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD`, open circuit breaker for that source.\n\n**EnrichmentError Structure**:\n```\nEnrichmentError:\n  record_id: string\n  enrichment_source: string\n  lookup_key: string\n  error_category: enum          # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT\n  error_code: string            # e.g., \"ENR_002_SOURCE_TIMEOUT\"\n  retry_count: integer\n  circuit_state: enum           # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n```\n\n**Circuit Breaker Configuration**: `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_THRESHOLD`, `ENRICHMENT_CIRCUIT_TIMEOUT_MS`\n\n#### Quality Score Errors\n\nOccur when quality scoring cannot complete or produces invalid results.\n\n**Handling**: Quality scoring errors are generally non-fatal. Records receive a quality score of 0.0 with flags indicating scoring failure. Processing continues to Module Gamma.\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Errors\n\nOccur when system resources are depleted during transformation processing.\n\n**Common Causes**: Memory pressure from large records, thread pool saturation, connection pool depletion\n\n**Handling**: Resource exhaustion triggers graceful degradation:\n1. Pause acceptance of new batches from Module Alpha\n2. Complete in-flight transformations\n3. Clear transformation caches\n4. Signal unhealthy status\n5. Resume when resources recover\n\n### Error Queue Management\n\nFailed records route to categorized error queues:\n- `beta_mapping_errors`: Schema mapping failures\n- `beta_transform_errors`: Field transformation failures\n- `beta_enrichment_errors`: Enrichment operation failures\n- `beta_critical_errors`: Unrecoverable errors\n\n**Queue Operations**: Inspection (query failures), Correction (update and mark for reprocessing), Replay (reinject corrected records), Expiration (auto-purge after retention)\n\n**Configuration**: `ERROR_QUEUE_CAPACITY`, `ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`, `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS`\n\n### Error Logging\n\nAll errors generate structured log entries:\n\n```\nTransformationErrorLog:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  level: enum                   # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL\n  error_category: string\n  error_code: string\n  message: string\n  record_id: string\n  batch_id: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `beta_errors_total`, `beta_retries_total`, `beta_circuit_breaker_trips`\n\n**Gauges**: `beta_error_queue_size`, `beta_circuit_breaker_state`, `beta_degradation_mode`\n\n**Histograms**: `beta_error_recovery_duration`, `beta_retry_delay_seconds`\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n**Mapping Recovery**: Log failure → route to queue → increment counters → continue → alert if threshold exceeded\n\n**Transformation Recovery**: Capture state → apply fallback → log outcome → continue or route\n\n**Enrichment Recovery**: Detect type → retry if transient → apply fallback → update circuit → continue\n\n**Resource Recovery**: Detect pressure → pause intake → drain queues → clear caches → wait → resume\n\n### Error Escalation\n\nWhen error rates exceed configured thresholds, the system escalates through multiple levels:\n\n**Level 1 - Warning**: Log elevated error rates, emit alert metrics\n**Level 2 - Throttle**: Reduce intake rate from Module Alpha\n**Level 3 - Circuit Break**: Open circuit breakers for failing enrichment sources\n**Level 4 - Halt**: Suspend all processing pending operator intervention\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nModule Beta behavior is controlled through configuration parameters.\n\n### Pipeline Configuration\n\n#### TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 8 | **Range**: 1-64\n\nNumber of concurrent transformation threads.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_BATCH_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 500 | **Range**: 1-10000\n\nRecords processed per transformation batch.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 30000 | **Range**: 1000-300000\n\nMaximum time allowed for transforming a single record.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_QUEUE_CAPACITY\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5000 | **Range**: 100-100000\n\nMaximum records queued for transformation.\n\n#### TRANSFORM_PROFILE_DEFAULT\n\n**Type**: String | **Default**: \"standard\"\n\nNamed transformation profile applied when none specified.\n\n### Enrichment Configuration\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 3600 | **Range**: 60-86400\n\nTime-to-live in seconds for cached enrichment results.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_CACHE_MAX_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 100000 | **Range**: 1000-10000000\n\nMaximum entries in the enrichment cache.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_TIMEOUT_MS\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 5000 | **Range**: 100-60000\n\nTimeout for individual enrichment operations.\n\n#### ENRICHMENT_MAX_RETRIES\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 3 | **Range**: 0-10\n\nMaximum retry attempts for transient enrichment failures.\n\n### Quality Configuration\n\n#### QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 0.7 | **Range**: 0.0-1.0\n\nQuality score below which a warning is logged.\n\n#### QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR\n\n**Type**: Float | **Default**: 0.3 | **Range**: 0.0-1.0\n\nQuality score below which the record is flagged as low quality.\n\n---\n\n## Integration Points\n\nModule Beta integrates with other Data Pipeline System components through well-defined interfaces.\n\n### Module Alpha Integration\n\nModule Beta receives validated records from Module Alpha through the standardized handoff protocol.\n\n**Handoff Reception**: Beta exposes an endpoint for receiving `TransformationRequest` batches. Upon receipt, Beta validates batch integrity, acknowledges receipt, and queues records for transformation.\n\n**Request Validation**: Verify batch checksum, confirm metadata, validate record count, check transformation profile exists.\n\n**Back-Pressure**: When queues approach capacity, Beta signals back-pressure through the integration layer, causing Alpha to pause delivery. See `integration-layer.md` for protocol details.\n\n### Module Gamma Integration\n\nModule Beta delivers transformed records to Module Gamma for output processing.\n\n**Handoff Payload**:\n```\nTransformationResponse:\n  batch_id: string\n  records: list<TransformedRecord>\n  transformation_summary: TransformationSummary\n  quality_summary: QualitySummary\n  checksum: string\n```\n\nFor complete handoff specifications, see `integration-layer.md`.\n\n### Enrichment Source Integration\n\nModule Beta connects to external enrichment sources:\n\n**Database Sources**: JDBC connections with pooling, health checking.\n\n**API Sources**: HTTP/HTTPS with authentication, rate limiting.\n\n**Cache Integration**: Distributed cache systems for enrichment caching.\n\n### Health Check Integration\n\nBeta exposes health status including component states, queue depths, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\n**Health Levels**: HEALTHY (normal), DEGRADED (reduced capacity), UNHEALTHY (processing halted)\n\n### Monitoring Integration\n\nBeta emits metrics for throughput, latency, quality, errors, and resources. Structured logs follow pipeline format.\n\n---\n\n## Compliance Requirements\n\nModule Beta implements compliance controls for audit, regulatory, and security requirements.\n\n### Audit Logging\n\nAll transformation operations are logged:\n\n**Record-Level Audit**: Original state, all transformations with before/after values, quality scores, final state.\n\n**Rule-Level Audit**: Rule identifier, input/output values, execution timing.\n\nAudit requirements specified in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 3.\n\n### Data Lineage\n\nModule Beta maintains transformation lineage:\n\n**Lineage Capture**: Source record ID, transformation session, rule sequence, enrichment references, output record ID.\n\n**Lineage Query**: Forward tracing (input to outputs) and backward tracing (output to inputs).\n\nLineage requirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 4.\n\n### Data Protection\n\n**Field-Level Encryption**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted during transformation.\n\n**Tokenization**: PII fields can be replaced with tokens.\n\n**Masking**: Fields can be partially masked for logging.\n\nRequirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 7.\n\n### Security Controls\n\n**Enrichment Source Authentication**: All external connections use appropriate authentication.\n\n**Transport Encryption**: Inter-module communication uses TLS.\n\n**Input Sanitization**: Transformation inputs are sanitized.\n\nRequirements in `compliance-requirements.md` Section 6.\n\n---\n\n*This document is the authoritative specification for Module Beta.

Examples: persistent connectivity loss, resource exhaustion, data corruption. Critical errors trigger alerts and may halt processing.\n\n**ERROR**: Failures preventing processing of specific records or batches without systemic failure. Examples: validation failures, transformation errors, delivery rejections.\n\n**WARNING**: Conditions that may indicate problems but do not prevent processing. Examples: elevated retry rates, degraded enrichment sources.\n\n#### Recoverability Classification\n\n**TRANSIENT**: May resolve through retry. Examples: network timeouts, temporary service unavailability, rate limiting. The Integration Layer applies retry logic with exponential backoff.\n\n**PERMANENT**: Will not resolve through retry. Examples: schema violations, invalid data formats, authorization failures. Bypass retry logic and proceed to error handling.\n\n#### Scope Classification\n\n**RECORD-LEVEL**: Affects individual records. Other records proceed normally.\n**BATCH-LEVEL**: Affects entire batches. All records in batch impacted.\n**MODULE-LEVEL**: Affects entire module operation.\n**PIPELINE-LEVEL**: Affects entire pipeline. All data flow halts.\n\n### Error Message Structure\n\n```\nIntegrationError:\n  error_id: string              # UUID v4 uniquely identifying this error\n  correlation_id: string        # Links to originating message/batch\n  timestamp: datetime           # When error was detected\n  source_module: enum           # ALPHA, BETA, GAMMA\n  severity: enum                # CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING\n  recoverability: enum          # TRANSIENT, PERMANENT, UNKNOWN\n  scope: enum                   # RECORD, BATCH, MODULE, PIPELINE\n  error_code: string            # Hierarchical code (e.g., \"INT_ALPHA_001\")\n  error_message: string         # Human-readable description\n  context: ErrorContext\n  retry_eligible: boolean\n```\n\n```\nErrorContext:\n  record_id: string             # Affected record (if record-level)\n  batch_id: string              # Affected batch (if batch-level)\n  field_name: string            # Affected field (if applicable)\n  expected_value: string\n  actual_value: string\n  upstream_errors: list<string> # Related upstream error IDs\n```\n\n### Module Alpha Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Alpha generates errors propagating through the Integration Layer. For complete specification, see `module-alpha.md` Section 5.\n\n**Connection Errors**: When source adapters cannot establish connectivity, Alpha generates MODULE-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer notifies downstream modules to expect reduced throughput.\n\n**Parse Errors**: When input parsing fails, Alpha generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. Failed records are excluded from batches with error details in batch metadata.\n\n**Validation Errors**: When records fail validation rules, Alpha generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer propagates summaries to Module Beta through `validation_summary`.\n\n**Buffer Overflow**: When Alpha's buffer reaches capacity without acknowledgment, Alpha generates MODULE-LEVEL errors triggering back-pressure protocols.\n\n### Module Beta Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Beta generates errors during transformation requiring Integration Layer coordination. For complete specification, see `module-beta.md` Section 5.\n\n**Mapping Errors**: When schema mapping fails, Beta generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer ensures failed records are excluded from downstream batches.\n\n**Transformation Errors**: When field transformations produce invalid results, Beta generates RECORD-LEVEL errors preserved in the transformation audit trail.\n\n**Enrichment Errors**: When external enrichment sources are unavailable, Beta generates errors with severity per configuration. The Integration Layer coordinates circuit breaker state.\n\n**Quality Score Failures**: When records fall below thresholds, Beta generates WARNING-level errors. The Integration Layer tracks quality degradation trends.\n\n### Module Gamma Error Handling Integration\n\nModule Gamma generates errors during output processing completing the error propagation chain. For complete specification, see `module-gamma.md` Section 6.\n\n**Rendering Errors**: When format rendering fails, Gamma generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer ensures failures are tracked against source records.\n\n**Routing Errors**: When no valid destination can be determined, Gamma generates RECORD-LEVEL errors. The Integration Layer may trigger re-evaluation of upstream rules.\n\n**Delivery Errors**: When destination delivery fails, Gamma generates errors with severity based on retry status. The Integration Layer coordinates retry timing and circuit breaker state.\n\n**Acknowledgment Errors**: When acknowledgments timeout or fail, Gamma generates WARNING or ERROR level issues. The Integration Layer ensures ambiguous states are tracked for reconciliation.\n\n### Cross-Module Error Propagation\n\n#### Downstream Propagation\n\n```\nBatchErrorSummary:\n  upstream_errors: integer\n  error_breakdown: map<string, integer>\n  affected_record_ids: list<string>\n```\n\nDownstream modules use this to skip failed records and adjust expectations.\n\n#### Upstream Propagation\n\n```\nErrorNotification:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  errors: list<IntegrationError>\n  action_required: enum         # NONE, THROTTLE, HALT, INVESTIGATE\n```\n\nUpstream modules use this to adjust production rates and trigger alerts.\n\n### Circuit Breaker Coordination\n\n```\nCircuitBreakerState:\n  circuit_id: string\n  state: enum                   # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN\n  failure_count: integer\n  last_failure: datetime\n  next_attempt: datetime\n```\n\n**CLOSED**: Normal operation. Failures increment counter.\n**OPEN**: Requests immediately rejected. Timer until half-open.\n**HALF_OPEN**: Single test request allowed.\n\n```\nCircuitStateChange:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  circuit_id: string\n  previous_state: enum\n  new_state: enum\n  affected_modules: list<enum>\n```\n\n### Error Recovery Procedures\n\n**Transient Network Errors**: Retry with exponential backoff. After exhaustion, reclassify as permanent.\n\n**Validation Failures**: No retry. Route to error queue with diagnostic context.\n\n**Resource Exhaustion**: Trigger back-pressure. Clear caches. Resume gradually.\n\n**Module Unavailability**: Open circuit breaker. Queue pending work. Alert operators.\n\n**Data Corruption**: Halt affected processing. Generate CRITICAL alert. Require intervention.\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `integration_errors_total`, `integration_retries_total`, `integration_circuit_breaker_trips_total`\n\n**Gauges**: `integration_error_queue_depth`, `integration_circuit_breaker_state`\n\n**Histograms**: `integration_error_recovery_duration_seconds`\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe Integration Layer provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for operational visibility.\n\n### Health Check Protocol\n\n```\nHealthCheckRequest:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  check_type: enum              # LIVENESS, READINESS, DETAILED\n```\n\n```\nHealthCheckResponse:\n  header: MessageHeader\n  status: enum                  # HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY\n  checks: list<ComponentHealth>\n  uptime_seconds: integer\n```\n\n```\nComponentHealth:\n  component_name: string\n  status: enum\n  message: string\n  last_check: datetime\n```\n\n### Pipeline Health Status\n\n```\nPipelineHealthStatus:\n  overall_status: enum          # HEALTHY, DEGRADED, UNHEALTHY\n  module_statuses: map<enum, ModuleHealth>\n  active_circuits_open: integer\n  error_rate_1m: float\n  throughput_records_per_second: float\n```\n\nStatus determination:\n- **HEALTHY**: All modules healthy, no circuits open, error rate below threshold\n- **DEGRADED**: Any module degraded OR any circuit open OR elevated error rate\n- **UNHEALTHY**: Any module unhealthy OR multiple circuits open\n\n### Throughput Metrics\n\n- `alpha_beta_batches_transferred_total`\n- `alpha_beta_records_transferred_total`\n- `beta_gamma_batches_transferred_total`\n- `beta_gamma_records_transferred_total`\n- `transfer_latency_seconds` (histogram)\n\n### Queue Depth Monitoring\n\n- `alpha_output_buffer_depth`\n- `beta_input_queue_depth`\n- `beta_output_buffer_depth`\n- `gamma_input_queue_depth`\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Alpha-to-Beta Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `ALPHA_BETA_BATCH_SIZE` | 1000 | Records per transfer batch |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000 | Max wait before flush |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30000 | Acknowledgment deadline |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | 1000 | Initial retry delay |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_MAX_RETRIES` | 5 | Maximum retry attempts |\n| `ALPHA_BETA_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER` | 2.0 | Retry backoff factor |\n\n### Beta-to-Gamma Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `BETA_GAMMA_BATCH_SIZE` | 500 | Records per transfer batch |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000 | Max wait before flush |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_ACK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 30000 | Acknowledgment deadline |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | 1000 | Initial retry delay |\n| `BETA_GAMMA_MAX_RETRIES` | 5 | Maximum retry attempts |\n\n### Back-Pressure Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `BACKPRESSURE_HIGH_WATERMARK` | 0.8 | Queue depth to activate |\n| `BACKPRESSURE_LOW_WATERMARK` | 0.5 | Queue depth to deactivate |\n\n### Circuit Breaker Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `CIRCUIT_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` | 5 | Failures to open circuit |\n| `CIRCUIT_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS` | 60000 | Duration before half-open |\n\n### Health Check Configuration\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS` | 10000 | Check frequency |\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS` | 5000 | Check deadline |\n\n---\n\n## Document References\n\n| Document | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| `data-pipeline-overview.md` | System architecture and overview |\n| `module-alpha.md` | Data ingestion module specification |\n| `module-beta.md` | Data transformation module specification |\n| `module-gamma.md` | Data output module specification |\n| `compliance-requirements.md` | Audit, security, and regulatory requirements |\n\n---\n\n*This document is the authoritative specification for the Integration Layer.

Validation encompasses type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity, and custom business rules.\n    30→\n    31→**Flow Control**: Managing throughput variations between high-velocity sources and downstream processing capacity through internal buffering, back-pressure signaling, and adaptive rate limiting.\n    32→\n    33→### Processing Model\n    34→\n    35→Module Alpha processes data through a staged pipeline:\n    36→\n    37→```\n    38→┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n    39→│                     MODULE ALPHA PIPELINE                        │\n    40→├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n    41→│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n    42→│  │    Source    │    │    Input     │    │  Validation  │      │\n    43→│  │   Adapter    │───▶│   Parser     │───▶│   Engine     │      │\n    44→│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘      │\n    45→│         │                   │                   │               │\n    46→│         ▼                   ▼                   ▼               │\n    47→│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n    48→│  │  Connection  │    │    Parse     │    │  Validation  │      │\n    49→│  │    Pool      │    │    Errors    │    │   Failures   │      │\n    50→│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────┬────────┘      │\n    51→│                                                 │               │\n    52→│                                          ┌──────▼──────┐       │\n    53→│                                          │   Output    │───────┼──▶ To Beta\n    54→│                                          │   Buffer    │       │\n    55→│                                          └─────────────┘       │\n    56→└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n    57→```\n    58→\n    59→### Design Principles\n    60→\n    61→**Fail-Forward Processing**: Individual record failures do not halt the pipeline. Failed records are captured with diagnostic context and routed to error handling while processing continues.\n    62→\n    63→**Source Agnosticism**: The core pipeline logic remains independent of source-specific protocols. Source adapters encapsulate all protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n    64→\n    65→**Defensive Parsing**: The parser assumes hostile or malformed input and validates all data before processing. Buffer overflows, injection attacks, and format corruption are handled gracefully.\n    66→\n    67→**Observable Operations**: All processing stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis.\n    68→\n    69→---\n    70→\n    71→## Input Sources\n    72→\n    73→Module Alpha supports data acquisition from multiple source types through dedicated source adapters.\n    74→\n    75→### REST API Sources\n    76→\n    77→REST API sources retrieve data through HTTP/HTTPS requests.

As the entry point for all data entering the pipeline, Module Alpha implements robust connectivity, parsing, validation, and buffering capabilities.\n\n### Core Responsibilities\n\n**Source Connectivity**: Establishing and maintaining connections to external data sources including REST APIs, relational databases, message queues, and file systems. The connectivity layer abstracts protocol-specific details behind a uniform interface.\n\n**Input Parsing**: Converting raw data from native source formats into the pipeline's internal record representation. The parsing engine handles character encoding variations, escape sequences, and format-specific syntax while preserving data fidelity.\n\n**Validation Engine**: Applying configurable validation rules to incoming records before they proceed to transformation. Validation encompasses type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity, and custom business rules.\n\n**Flow Control**: Managing throughput variations between high-velocity sources and downstream processing capacity through internal buffering, back-pressure signaling, and adaptive rate limiting.\n\n### Processing Model\n\nModule Alpha processes data through a staged pipeline:\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                     MODULE ALPHA PIPELINE                        │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n│  │    Source    │    │    Input     │    │  Validation  │      │\n│  │   Adapter    │───▶│   Parser     │───▶│   Engine     │      │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘      │\n│         │                   │                   │               │\n│         ▼                   ▼                   ▼               │\n│  ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐      │\n│  │  Connection  │    │    Parse     │    │  Validation  │      │\n│  │    Pool      │    │    Errors    │    │   Failures   │      │\n│  └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────┬────────┘      │\n│                                                 │               │\n│                                          ┌──────▼──────┐       │\n│                                          │   Output    │───────┼──▶ To Beta\n│                                          │   Buffer    │       │\n│                                          └─────────────┘       │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**Fail-Forward Processing**: Individual record failures do not halt the pipeline. Failed records are captured with diagnostic context and routed to error handling while processing continues.\n\n**Source Agnosticism**: The core pipeline logic remains independent of source-specific protocols. Source adapters encapsulate all protocol-specific concerns, presenting a uniform interface.\n\n**Defensive Parsing**: The parser assumes hostile or malformed input and validates all data before processing. Buffer overflows, injection attacks, and format corruption are handled gracefully.\n\n**Observable Operations**: All processing stages emit metrics and structured log entries enabling real-time monitoring, alerting, and post-hoc analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Input Sources\n\nModule Alpha supports data acquisition from multiple source types through dedicated source adapters.\n\n### REST API Sources\n\nREST API sources retrieve data through HTTP/HTTPS requests. Supported features include:\n- Authentication: API keys, OAuth 2.0, HTTP Basic, client certificates\n- Request configuration: HTTP methods, custom headers, pagination handling\n- Response processing: JSON/XML parsing, envelope unwrapping, rate limit handling\n- Connection management: pooling, keep-alive, retry with exponential backoff, circuit breaker\n\n### Database Sources\n\nDatabase sources retrieve data through JDBC connections to PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and other JDBC-compliant systems. Features include:\n- Parameterized queries preventing SQL injection\n- Cursor-based result streaming for large datasets\n- Connection pooling with health checking\n- Dynamic schema discovery and type mapping\n\n### Message Queue Sources\n\nMessage queue sources consume from Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, Amazon SQS, and Azure Service Bus:\n- Consumer group management for parallel consumption\n- Configurable delivery semantics (at-least-once, exactly-once)\n- Dead letter queue routing for poison messages\n- Back-pressure handling through consumer pause/resume\n\n### File System Sources\n\nFile system sources read from local or networked file systems:\n- Formats: CSV, TSV, JSON, XML, Parquet, Avro\n- Discovery: glob patterns, recursive traversal, modification time filtering\n- Processing modes: batch, tail mode, checkpoint-based resumption\n\n### Source Adapter Interface\n\nAll source adapters implement a common interface:\n\n```\nSourceAdapter Interface:\n  - connect(): Establish connection to source\n  - disconnect(): Release connection resources\n  - fetch(batch_size): Retrieve next batch of raw records\n  - acknowledge(record_ids): Confirm successful processing\n  - get_metrics(): Return adapter-specific metrics\n  - health_check(): Verify source availability\n```\n\n---\n\n## Data Structures\n\nModule Alpha defines structures representing records at various pipeline stages.\n\n### RawRecord\n\nRepresents data as received from a source adapter before parsing:\n\n```\nRawRecord:\n  source_id: string           #

When circuit breaker opens, adapter reports degraded health status.\n\n**Configuration**:\n- `CONNECTION_RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY_MS`: Initial retry delay\n- `CONNECTION_RETRY_MAX_DELAY_MS`: Maximum retry delay\n- `CONNECTION_RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`: Backoff multiplier\n- `MAX_CONNECTION_RETRIES`: Maximum retry attempts\n- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`: Failures before opening\n- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_TIMEOUT_MS`: Time before half-open\n\n**Error Propagation**: Connection errors are reported to the integration layer. See `integration-layer.md` for propagation protocols.\n\n#### Parse Errors\n\nOccur when raw input cannot be converted to internal format.\n\n**Common Causes**: Malformed syntax, encoding mismatches, unexpected schema, truncated records, corruption\n\n**Handling**: Create ParseFailure record with original input, error location, and details. Route to parse error queue while continuing processing.\n\n**ParseFailure Structure**:\n```\nParseFailure:\n  raw_record: RawRecord\n  error_location: string      # line:column or byte offset\n  expected_token: string\n  parser_state: string\n  partial_result: map<string, FieldValue>\n  failure_timestamp: datetime\n  error_code: string          # e.g., \"PARSE_001_INVALID_JSON\"\n```\n\n**Metrics**:\n- `alpha_parse_errors_total`: Counter by error code\n- `alpha_parse_error_rate`: Failures per second\n- `alpha_parse_error_by_source`: Failures by source adapter\n\n#### Validation Errors\n\nOccur when parsed records fail validation rules.\n\n**Common Causes**: Missing required fields, type mismatches, out-of-range values, pattern failures, referential violations\n\n**Handling**: Capture in ValidationFailure records. Route based on severity:\n- **WARNING**: Proceed with quality flags\n- **ERROR**: Route to validation error queue\n- **CRITICAL**: Route to critical queue, generate alerts\n\n**Threshold Configuration**:\n- `VALIDATION_WARNING_RATE_THRESHOLD`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR_RATE_THRESHOLD`\n- `VALIDATION_ALERT_RATE_THRESHOLD`\n\n#### Buffer Overflow Errors\n\nOccur when internal buffers reach capacity.\n\n**Common Causes**: Downstream slower than ingestion, Module Beta back-pressure, network issues, resource contention\n\n**Handling**: Trigger back-pressure signaling to source adapters. Adapters pause retrieval (Kafka consumer pause, database throttling, API rate limiting).\n\n**BackPressureEvent Structure**:\n```\nBackPressureEvent:\n  buffer_id: string\n  event_type: enum            # ACTIVATED, DEACTIVATED, THRESHOLD_WARNING\n  current_utilization: float  # 0.0 to 1.0\n  duration_active_ms: integer\n  affected_sources: list<string>\n```\n\n#### Resource Exhaustion Errors\n\nOccur when system resources are depleted.\n\n**Common Causes**: Memory leaks, file handle exhaustion, thread pool saturation, disk space exhaustion\n\n**Handling**: Graceful degradation - suspend non-critical operations, clear caches, signal unhealthy status. Severe exhaustion triggers controlled shutdown.\n\n**Degradation Procedures**:\n1. Clear non-essential caches\n2. Reduce buffer sizes\n3. Pause non-critical sources\n4. Signal unhealthy status\n5. Initiate graceful shutdown if recovery fails\n\n### Error Queue Management\n\nFailed records route to dedicated error queues supporting:\n- **Inspection**: Query failed records with diagnostics\n- **Replay**: Reinject corrected records\n- **Expiration**: Auto-purge after retention period\n- **Export**: External analysis/reporting\n\n**Configuration**:\n- `PARSE_ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`\n- `VALIDATION_ERROR_RETENTION_HOURS`\n- `CRITICAL_ERROR_RETENTION_DAYS`\n\n### Error Logging\n\nAll errors generate structured log entries:\n\n```\nErrorLogEntry:\n  timestamp: datetime\n  level: enum                 # DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL\n  error_category: string\n  error_code: string\n  message: string\n  record_id: string\n  source_id: string\n  correlation_id: string\n  stack_trace: string         # Only for unexpected errors\n  context: map<string, string>\n```\n\n### Error Metrics\n\n**Counters**: `alpha_errors_total`, `alpha_retries_total`, `alpha_circuit_breaker_trips_total`\n\n**Gauges**: `alpha_error_queue_size`, `alpha_circuit_breaker_state`, `alpha_backpressure_active`\n\n**Histograms**: `alpha_error_recovery_duration_seconds`, `alpha_retry_delay_seconds`\n\n### Recovery Procedures\n\n**Connection Recovery**: Detect failure → close resources → wait → reconnect with fresh credentials → verify → resume or escalate\n\n**Parse Recovery**: Log failure → route to error queue → increment counters → continue processing → alert if threshold exceeded\n\n**Validation Recovery**: Capture failures → determine severity → route appropriately → apply defaults → emit quality score\n\n**Resource Recovery**: Detect pressure → clear caches → pause sources → wait → gradually resume\n\n**Buffer Recovery**: Detect back-pressure condition → signal upstream → drain buffer → resume when utilization below low watermark\n\n---\n\n## Configuration\n\nModule Alpha behavior is controlled through configuration parameters.\n\n### Connection Configuration\n\n#### DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE\n\n**Type**: Integer | **Default**: 1000 | **Range**: 1-100000\n\nRecords to fetch per batch operation.

[Deployment Considerations](#deployment-considerations)\n    15→\n    16→---\n    17→\n    18→## System Purpose\n    19→\n    20→The Data Pipeline System provides a robust, scalable platform for processing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data from multiple external sources through a series of transformation stages, ultimately delivering formatted output to various downstream consumers. The system is designed to handle batch and near-real-time processing workloads with configurable throughput characteristics.\n    21→\n    22→### Business Context\n    23→\n    24→Modern enterprises generate and consume vast quantities of data from disparate sources including transactional databases, event streams, third-party APIs, and file-based exports. The Data Pipeline System addresses the fundamental challenge of consolidating, normalizing, and distributing this data in a consistent, reliable manner.\n    25→\n    26→The system serves several critical business functions:\n    27→\n    28→**Data Consolidation**: Multiple upstream data sources are ingested through a unified interface, eliminating the need for point-to-point integrations between source systems and downstream consumers. This consolidation reduces integration complexity and provides a single point of data governance.\n    29→\n    30→**Data Quality Assurance**: Raw data from external sources frequently contains inconsistencies, missing values, and format variations. The pipeline applies comprehensive validation and transformation rules to ensure output data meets established quality standards before delivery to consumers.\n    31→\n    32→**Operational Efficiency**: By centralizing data processing logic in a purpose-built pipeline system, organizations avoid duplicating transformation code across multiple applications. Changes to data formats or business rules can be implemented once in the pipeline rather than propagated across numerous downstream systems.\n    33→\n    34→**Audit and Compliance**: Financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries require comprehensive audit trails for data movement and transformation. The Data Pipeline System provides built-in logging and traceability capabilities to support compliance requirements. For detailed compliance specifications, see `compliance-requirements.md`.\n    35→\n    36→### Technical Objectives\n    37→\n    38→The Data Pipeline System achieves its business objectives through the following technical capabilities:\n    39→\n    40→**High Throughput Processing**: The system is designed to process millions of records per hour through parallel processing and efficient memory utilization. Configurable batch sizes and worker pool settings allow operators to tune performance characteristics for specific deployment environments.\n    41→\n    42→**Fault Tolerance**: Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. The system isolates failures, routes problematic records to dead letter queues for later analysis, and continues processing valid data. Comprehensive error classification enables targeted remediation.\n    43→\n    44→**Extensibility**: New data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations can be added through well-defined interfaces without modifying core pipeline logic. The modular architecture supports incremental capability expansion.\n    45→\n    46→**Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and health check endpoints provide operators with real-time visibility into pipeline status, throughput, and error rates. Integration with standard monitoring platforms enables proactive alerting and capacity planning.\n    47→\n    48→---\n    49→\n    50→## Architecture Overview\n    51→\n    52→The Data Pipeline System follows a three-stage processing model where data flows sequentially through ingestion, transformation, and output modules. Each module is independently deployable and communicates with adjacent modules through well-defined message protocols.\n    53→\n    54→### System Architecture Diagram\n    55→\n    56→```\n

See `module-gamma.md` for the complete output specification.\n   138→\n   139→### Inter-Module Communication\n   140→\n   141→Modules communicate through a standardized message protocol that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data integrity and traceability. The integration layer defines message formats, handoff procedures, and error propagation patterns. See `integration-layer.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n   142→\n   143→---\n   144→\n   145→## Module Summary\n   146→\n   147→This section provides a high-level overview of each module's responsibilities and key capabilities. For detailed specifications, consult the individual module documentation.\n   148→\n   149→### Module Alpha: Data Ingestion\n   150→\n   151→Module Alpha serves as the entry point for all data entering the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n   152→\n   153→**Source Connectivity**: Alpha supports multiple input source types including REST APIs, relational databases via JDBC, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file-based inputs (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet). Source adapters implement a common interface that abstracts connection management, authentication, and data retrieval.\n   154→\n   155→**Input Parsing**: Raw data from external sources is parsed into the pipeline's internal record format. The parsing engine handles various encodings, escape sequences, and format variations. Malformed inputs are captured with contextual error information for later analysis.\n   156→\n   157→**Validation Engine**: Alpha applies configurable validation rules to incoming records. Validations include type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity checks, and custom business rules. Records failing validation are routed to error handling with detailed failure descriptions.\n   158→\n   159→**Buffering and Flow Control**: To manage throughput variations between sources and downstream processing, Alpha maintains internal buffers with configurable size limits. Back-pressure mechanisms prevent memory exhaustion when downstream modules cannot keep pace with ingestion rates.\n   160→\n   161→Key configuration parameters include `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VALIDATION_STRICT_MODE`, and `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK`. See `module-alpha.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   162→\n   163→### Module Beta: Data Transformation\n   164→\n   165→Module Beta transforms ingested records into the format required by downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n   166→\n   167→**Schema Mapping**: Beta maps fields from the internal record format to target schemas. Mapping rules support field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic. Multiple output schemas can be active simultaneously.\n   168→\n   169→**Field Transformation**: Individual fields undergo transformation operations including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformation rules are evaluated in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent rules.\n   170→\n   171→**Data Enrichment**: Records can be enriched with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. Enrichment operations support caching to minimize repeated lookups for frequently referenced values.\n   172→\n   173→**Quality Scoring**: Each record receives a quality score based on completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns. Scores enable downstream consumers to make informed decisions about data reliability. Configurable thresholds trigger warnings or errors for low-quality records.\n   174→\n   175→Key configuration parameters include `TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM`, `ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR`, and `MAX_TRANSFORM_TIME_MS`. See `module-beta.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   176→\n   177→### Module Gamma: Data Output\n   178→\n   179→Module Gamma delivers transformed records to downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n   180→\n   181→**Format Rendering**: Records are rendered into output formats appropriate for each destination. Supported formats include JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom formats defined via templates. Rendering handles character encoding, escaping, and structural requirements.\n   182→\n   183→**Delivery Routing**: Records are routed to appropriate destinations based on content, quality scores, or configuration rules. Routing supports fan-out patterns where a single record is delivered to multiple destinations, as well as conditional routing based on record attributes.\n   184→\n   185→**Acknowledgment Handling**: Gamma tracks delivery status and processes acknowledgments from destinations. Successful deliveries update tracking records; failures trigger retry logic according to configured policies. Persistent failures route records to the dead letter queue.\n   186→\n   187→**Dead Letter Queue**: Records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts are written to a dead letter queue with comprehensive diagnostic information. Operators can inspect, correct, and replay failed records through administrative interfaces.\n   188→\n   189→Key configuration parameters include `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. See `module-gamma.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n   190→\n   191→---\n   192→\n   193→## Data Flow\n   194→\n   195→Data moves through the pipeline in a sequential, stage-gated process. This section describes the end-to-end flow from source ingestion through final delivery.\n   196→\n   197→### Stage 1: Source Acquisition\n   198→\n   199→The pipeline execution begins when Module Alpha initiates data retrieval from configured sources. Source adapters establish connections, authenticate as necessary, and begin extracting data according to their specific protocols.\n   200→\n   201→For pull-based sources (databases, APIs), Alpha issues queries or requests according to configured schedules or triggers. For push-based sources (message queues, file drops), Alpha monitors inbound channels and processes data as it arrives.\n   202→\n   203→Raw data is captured in its native format and passed to the parsing engine. Source metadata including origin identifier, extraction timestamp, and batch sequence number is attached to each data unit.\n   204→\n   205→### Stage 2: Parsing and Initial Validation\n   206→\n   207→The parsing engine converts raw data into the pipeline's internal record format. Each source type has an associated parser that understands the source's data structure and extracts individual records.\n   208→\n   209→Parsing failures generate detailed error records capturing the malformed input, error location, and failure reason. Failed parses are logged and routed to error handling; they do not halt processing of valid records.\n   210→\n   211→Successfully parsed records undergo initial validation in Module Alpha. Validation rules check basic data integrity including required field presence, type conformance, and format validity. Records passing validation proceed to the buffering queue.\n   212→\n   213→### Stage 3: Module Handoff (Alpha to Beta)\n   214→\n   215→When the Alpha output buffer reaches the configured batch threshold or a flush timeout expires, accumulated records are packaged into a transfer batch. The batch includes metadata identifying the source batch, record count, and checksum.\n   216→\n   217→The integration layer mediates the handoff between Alpha and Beta. It validates batch integrity, manages flow control when Beta is processing slowly, and handles retry logic if the initial handoff fails. See `integration-layer.md` for handoff protocol details.\n   218→\n   219→Beta acknowledges batch receipt, at which point Alpha can release buffer space and proceed with additional ingestion. If acknowledgment is not received within the configured timeout, Alpha initiates retry procedures.\n   220→\n   221→### Stage 4: Transformation Processing\n   222→\n   223→Module Beta processes each record through its transformation pipeline. The transformation stages execute in sequence:\n   224→\n   225→**Schema Mapping** applies field mapping rules to convert records from the internal format to target schemas. Records may be mapped to multiple output schemas simultaneously.\n   226→\n   227→**Field Transformation** applies transformation rules to individual fields. Transformations execute in priority order, with each transformation potentially depending on results from earlier transformations.\n   228→\n   229→**Data Enrichment** augments records with data from external reference sources. The enrichment engine manages cache lookups, external service calls, and timeout handling.\n   230→\n   231→**Quality Scoring** evaluates each record against quality criteria and assigns a numeric score. Records below configured thresholds may be flagged, logged, or rejected depending on configuration.\n   232→\n   233→### Stage 5: Module Handoff (Beta to Gamma)\n   234→\n   235→Transformed records are batched for handoff to Module Gamma following the same batch protocol used between Alpha and Beta. The integration layer ensures reliable transfer with acknowledgment and retry support.\n   236→\n   237→Batch metadata is extended to include transformation summary statistics: record count, average quality score, error count, and enrichment hit rate. This metadata supports operational monitoring.\n   238→\n   239→### Stage 6: Output Rendering and Delivery\n   240→\n   241→Module Gamma receives transformed batches and routes individual records to their designated destinations. For each record:\n   242→\n   243→**Destination Determination** evaluates routing rules to identify target destinations. A record may have one or multiple destinations.\n   244→\n   245→**Format Rendering** converts the record to the format required by each destination. Rendering is performed independently for each destination, allowing different formats for the same record.\n   246→\n   247→**Delivery Execution** transmits the rendered record to the destination. The delivery engine manages connection pooling, authentication, and transmission protocols specific to each destination type.\n   248→\n   249→**Acknowledgment Processing** waits for confirmation of successful delivery. Confirmed records update completion tracking; failed records enter retry queues.\n   250→\n   251→### Stage 7: Completion and Reconciliation\n   252→\n   253→When all records in a batch have been delivered (or routed to dead letter queue after retry exhaustion), Gamma reports batch completion to upstream modules. Completion reports include delivery statistics: success count, retry count, DLQ count, and timing metrics.\n   254→\n   255→The pipeline maintains end-to-end tracking that enables reconciliation between ingested and delivered records. Discrepancies trigger alerts for operator investigation.\n   256→\n   257→---\n   258→\n   259→## Cross-Cutting Concerns\n   260→\n   261→Several concerns span multiple modules and require coordinated implementation. This section describes these cross-cutting aspects and references their detailed specifications.\n   262→\n   263→### Error Handling Philosophy\n   264→\n   265→The Data Pipeline System follows a \"fail forward\" error handling philosophy. Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. Instead, failed records are isolated, logged with diagnostic information, and routed to appropriate error handling channels while processing continues for valid records.\n   266→\n   267→Error handling operates at multiple levels:\n   268→\n   269→**Record-Level Errors** affect individual records and are handled within the module where they occur. The record is marked as failed, diagnostic information is captured, and the record is routed to the module's error queue.\n   270→\n   271→**Batch-Level Errors** affect entire batches (e.g., network failures during handoff) and are handled by the integration layer's retry mechanisms.\n   272→\n   273→**Module-Level Errors** affect module operation (e.g., resource exhaustion) and may require operator intervention.\n   274→\n   275→Each module documents its specific error handling behaviors. For cross-module error propagation patterns, see `integration-layer.md`.\n   276→\n   277→### Logging and Observability\n   278→\n   279→All modules emit structured log entries following a common format that enables log aggregation and analysis. Log entries include:\n   280→\n   281→- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n   282→- Module identifier\n   283→- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)\n   284→- Correlation ID linking related entries\n   285→- Structured payload with context-specific fields\n   286→\n   287→Metrics are emitted via a standard metrics interface supporting integration with Prometheus, StatsD, and similar platforms. Standard metrics include throughput rates, latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.\n   288→\n   289→Health check endpoints expose module status for load balancer and orchestration platform integration. See `integration-layer.md` for health check specifications.\n   290→\n   291→### Compliance and Audit Requirements\n   292→\n   293→The pipeline supports compliance requirements through comprehensive audit logging and data lineage tracking. Audit events capture:\n   294→\n   295→- Data origin and ingestion timestamp\n   296→- All transformation operations applied\n   297→- Delivery confirmation with destination and timestamp\n   298→- User or system actions affecting pipeline configuration\n   299→\n   300→Audit logs are retained according to configurable policies and can be exported to external audit systems. Compliance requirements are detailed in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n   301→\n   302→### Security Considerations\n   303→\n   304→Security is implemented through multiple mechanisms:\n   305→\n   306→**Transport Security**: All inter-module communication uses TLS encryption. External connections support TLS with certificate validation.\n   307→\n   308→**Authentication**: Source and destination connections use appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, certificates, database credentials).\n   309→\n   310→**Authorization**: Pipeline operations are governed by role-based access control. Configuration changes require elevated privileges.\n   311→\n   312→**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption supports scenarios where certain fields must remain protected through the pipeline.\n   313→\n   314→Detailed security requirements are specified in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n   315→\n   316→---\n   317→\n   318→## Configuration Management\n   319→\n   320→Pipeline configuration follows a hierarchical model where default values can be overridden at increasingly specific levels.\n   321→\n   322→### Configuration Hierarchy\n   323→\n   324→1. **System Defaults**: Built-in defaults for all configuration parameters\n   325→2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)\n   326→3. **Module Configuration**: Module-specific parameter overrides\n   327→4. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Settings for specific sources or destinations\n   328→\n   329→Lower levels in the hierarchy override higher levels, allowing targeted configuration while maintaining sensible defaults.\n   330→\n   331→### Configuration Parameters\n   332→\n   333→Each module defines its configuration parameters in its detailed specification. Cross-module parameters defined in this overview include:\n   334→\n   335→| Parameter | Default | Description |\n   336→|-----------|---------|-------------|\n   337→| `PIPELINE_NAME` | `default` | Identifier for this pipeline instance |\n   338→| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum log level to emit |\n   339→| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether to emit metrics |\n   340→| `METRICS_PREFIX` | `datapipeline` | Prefix for metric names |\n   341→| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` | `8080` | Port for health check endpoint |\n   342→\n   343→### Configuration Updates\n   344→\n   345→Configuration changes can be applied without pipeline restart through the configuration reload mechanism. Modules detect configuration changes and apply them at safe points in processing.\n   346→\n   347→Some parameters require restart due to their nature (e.g., network ports, resource pool sizes). These are documented in module specifications.\n   348→\n   349→---\n   350→\n   351→## Deployment Considerations\n   352→\n   353→The Data Pipeline System supports various deployment models from single-node development environments to distributed production clusters.\n   354→\n   355→### Deployment Modes\n   356→\n   357→**Standalone Mode**: All modules run within a single process, suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. Inter-module communication uses in-memory queues.\n   358→\n   359→**Distributed Mode**: Each module runs as an independent service, communicating via network protocols. This mode supports horizontal scaling and fault isolation.\n   360→\n   361→**Hybrid Mode**: Selected modules are co-located while others run independently, balancing deployment complexity against scaling requirements.\n   362→\n   363→### Scaling Considerations\n   364→\n   365→**Module Alpha** scales based on source volume and variety. Multiple Alpha instances can partition source responsibility, or a single instance can handle multiple sources with connection pooling.\n   366→\n   367→**Module Beta** scales based on transformation complexity. Transformation is inherently parallelizable; adding Beta instances provides near-linear throughput improvement.\n   368→\n   369→**Module Gamma** scales based on destination count and delivery latency. Destinations with high latency may require dedicated Gamma instances to prevent bottlenecks.\n   370→\n   371→### High Availability\n   372→\n   373→Production deployments should include:\n   374→\n   375→- Multiple instances of each module for failover\n   376→- Health monitoring with automatic instance replacement\n   377→- Persistent queues between modules to prevent data loss during failures\n   378→- Geographic distribution for disaster recovery scenarios\n   379→\n   380→---\n   381→\n   382→## Document References\n   383→\n   384→This overview document provides architectural context for the Data Pipeline System.

[Deployment Considerations](#deployment-considerations)\n\n---\n\n## System Purpose\n\nThe Data Pipeline System provides a robust, scalable platform for processing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data from multiple external sources through a series of transformation stages, ultimately delivering formatted output to various downstream consumers. The system is designed to handle batch and near-real-time processing workloads with configurable throughput characteristics.\n\n### Business Context\n\nModern enterprises generate and consume vast quantities of data from disparate sources including transactional databases, event streams, third-party APIs, and file-based exports. The Data Pipeline System addresses the fundamental challenge of consolidating, normalizing, and distributing this data in a consistent, reliable manner.\n\nThe system serves several critical business functions:\n\n**Data Consolidation**: Multiple upstream data sources are ingested through a unified interface, eliminating the need for point-to-point integrations between source systems and downstream consumers. This consolidation reduces integration complexity and provides a single point of data governance.\n\n**Data Quality Assurance**: Raw data from external sources frequently contains inconsistencies, missing values, and format variations. The pipeline applies comprehensive validation and transformation rules to ensure output data meets established quality standards before delivery to consumers.\n\n**Operational Efficiency**: By centralizing data processing logic in a purpose-built pipeline system, organizations avoid duplicating transformation code across multiple applications. Changes to data formats or business rules can be implemented once in the pipeline rather than propagated across numerous downstream systems.\n\n**Audit and Compliance**: Financial, healthcare, and other regulated industries require comprehensive audit trails for data movement and transformation. The Data Pipeline System provides built-in logging and traceability capabilities to support compliance requirements. For detailed compliance specifications, see `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n### Technical Objectives\n\nThe Data Pipeline System achieves its business objectives through the following technical capabilities:\n\n**High Throughput Processing**: The system is designed to process millions of records per hour through parallel processing and efficient memory utilization. Configurable batch sizes and worker pool settings allow operators to tune performance characteristics for specific deployment environments.\n\n**Fault Tolerance**: Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. The system isolates failures, routes problematic records to dead letter queues for later analysis, and continues processing valid data. Comprehensive error classification enables targeted remediation.\n\n**Extensibility**: New data sources, transformation rules, and output destinations can be added through well-defined interfaces without modifying core pipeline logic. The modular architecture supports incremental capability expansion.\n\n**Observability**: Built-in metrics, structured logging, and health check endpoints provide operators with real-time visibility into pipeline status, throughput, and error rates. Integration with standard monitoring platforms enables proactive alerting and capacity planning.\n\n---\n\n## Architecture Overview\n\nThe Data Pipeline System follows a three-stage processing model where data flows sequentially through ingestion, transformation, and output modules. Each module is independently deployable and communicates with adjacent modules through well-defined message protocols.\n\n### System Architecture

clearly defined responsibilities:\n\n**Module Alpha** handles all data ingestion concerns including source connectivity, input parsing, initial validation, and buffering. Alpha's primary responsibility is accepting raw data from external sources and converting it into the pipeline's internal record format. See `module-alpha.md` for the complete ingestion specification.\n\n**Module Beta** performs all data transformation operations including schema mapping, field-level transformations, data enrichment from reference sources, and quality scoring. Beta receives validated records from Alpha and produces enriched, normalized records ready for output. See `module-beta.md` for the complete transformation specification.\n\n**Module Gamma** manages all output concerns including format rendering, delivery routing, acknowledgment handling, and dead letter queue management. Gamma receives transformed records from Beta and ensures reliable delivery to downstream consumers. See `module-gamma.md` for the complete output specification.\n\n### Inter-Module Communication\n\nModules communicate through a standardized message protocol that ensures loose coupling while maintaining data integrity and traceability. The integration layer defines message formats, handoff procedures, and error propagation patterns. See `integration-layer.md` for the complete protocol specification.\n\n---\n\n## Module Summary\n\nThis section provides a high-level overview of each module's responsibilities and key capabilities. For detailed specifications, consult the individual module documentation.\n\n### Module Alpha: Data Ingestion\n\nModule Alpha serves as the entry point for all data entering the pipeline. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Source Connectivity**: Alpha supports multiple input source types including REST APIs, relational databases via JDBC, message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ), and file-based inputs (CSV, JSON, XML, Parquet). Source adapters implement a common interface that abstracts connection management, authentication, and data retrieval.\n\n**Input Parsing**: Raw data from external sources is parsed into the pipeline's internal record format. The parsing engine handles various encodings, escape sequences, and format variations. Malformed inputs are captured with contextual error information for later analysis.\n\n**Validation Engine**: Alpha applies configurable validation rules to incoming records. Validations include type checking, format verification, range constraints, referential integrity checks, and custom business rules. Records failing validation are routed to error handling with detailed failure descriptions.\n\n**Buffering and Flow Control**: To manage throughput variations between sources and downstream processing, Alpha maintains internal buffers with configurable size limits. Back-pressure mechanisms prevent memory exhaustion when downstream modules cannot keep pace with ingestion rates.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`, `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`, `CONNECTION_TIMEOUT_MS`, `VALIDATION_STRICT_MODE`, and `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK`. See `module-alpha.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n### Module Beta: Data Transformation\n\nModule Beta transforms ingested records into the format required by downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Schema Mapping**: Beta maps fields from the internal record format to target schemas. Mapping rules support field renaming, type conversion, composite field construction, and conditional logic. Multiple output schemas can be active simultaneously.\n\n**Field Transformation**: Individual fields undergo transformation operations including string manipulation, numeric calculations, date/time reformatting, encoding conversion, and lookup table substitution. Transformation rules are evaluated in a defined sequence with intermediate results available to subsequent rules.\n\n**Data Enrichment**: Records can be enriched with data from external reference sources including lookup databases, caching layers, and external APIs. Enrichment operations support caching to minimize repeated lookups for frequently referenced values.\n\n**Quality Scoring**: Each record receives a quality score based on completeness, consistency, and conformance to expected patterns. Scores enable downstream consumers to make informed decisions about data reliability. Configurable thresholds trigger warnings or errors for low-quality records.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `TRANSFORM_PARALLELISM`, `ENRICHMENT_CACHE_TTL`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_WARN`, `QUALITY_THRESHOLD_ERROR`, and `MAX_TRANSFORM_TIME_MS`. See `module-beta.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n### Module Gamma: Data Output\n\nModule Gamma delivers transformed records to downstream consumers. Its responsibilities include:\n\n**Format Rendering**: Records are rendered into output formats appropriate for each destination. Supported formats include JSON, XML, CSV, Avro, Parquet, and custom formats defined via templates. Rendering handles character encoding, escaping, and structural requirements.\n\n**Delivery Routing**: Records are routed to appropriate destinations based on content, quality scores, or configuration rules. Routing supports fan-out patterns where a single record is delivered to multiple destinations, as well as conditional routing based on record attributes.\n\n**Acknowledgment Handling**: Gamma tracks delivery status and processes acknowledgments from destinations. Successful deliveries update tracking records; failures trigger retry logic according to configured policies. Persistent failures route records to the dead letter queue.\n\n**Dead Letter Queue**: Records that cannot be delivered after exhausting retry attempts are written to a dead letter queue with comprehensive diagnostic information. Operators can inspect, correct, and replay failed records through administrative interfaces.\n\nKey configuration parameters include `DELIVERY_TIMEOUT_MS`, `MAX_DELIVERY_RETRIES`, `RETRY_BACKOFF_MULTIPLIER`, `DLQ_RETENTION_DAYS`, and `ACK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS`. See `module-gamma.md` for complete configuration documentation.\n\n---\n\n## Data Flow\n\nData moves through the pipeline in a sequential, stage-gated process. This section describes the end-to-end flow from source ingestion through final delivery.\n\n### Stage 1: Source Acquisition\n\nThe pipeline execution begins when Module Alpha initiates data retrieval from configured sources. Source adapters establish connections, authenticate as necessary, and begin extracting data according to their specific protocols.\n\nFor pull-based sources (databases, APIs), Alpha issues queries or requests according to configured schedules or triggers. For push-based sources (message queues, file drops), Alpha monitors inbound channels and processes data as it arrives.\n\nRaw data is captured in its native format and passed to the parsing engine. Source metadata including origin identifier, extraction timestamp, and batch sequence number is attached to each data unit.\n\n### Stage 2: Parsing and Initial Validation\n\nThe parsing engine converts raw data into the pipeline's internal record format. Each source type has an associated parser that understands the source's data structure and extracts individual records.\n\nParsing failures generate detailed error records capturing the malformed input, error location, and failure reason. Failed parses are logged and routed to error handling; they do not halt processing of valid records.\n\nSuccessfully parsed records undergo initial validation in Module Alpha. Validation rules check basic data integrity including required field presence, type conformance, and format validity. Records passing validation proceed to the buffering queue.\n\n### Stage 3: Module Handoff (Alpha to Beta)\n\nWhen the Alpha output buffer reaches the configured batch threshold or a flush timeout expires, accumulated records are packaged into a transfer batch. The batch includes metadata identifying the source batch, record count, and checksum.\n\nThe integration layer mediates the handoff between Alpha and Beta. It validates batch integrity, manages flow control when Beta is processing slowly, and handles retry logic if the initial handoff fails. See `integration-layer.md` for handoff protocol details.\n\nBeta acknowledges batch receipt, at which point Alpha can release buffer space and proceed with additional ingestion. If acknowledgment is not received within the configured timeout, Alpha initiates retry procedures.\n\n### Stage 4: Transformation Processing\n\nModule Beta processes each record through its transformation pipeline. The transformation stages execute in sequence:\n\n**Schema Mapping** applies field mapping rules to convert records from the internal format to target schemas. Records may be mapped to multiple output schemas simultaneously.\n\n**Field Transformation** applies transformation rules to individual fields. Transformations execute in priority order, with each transformation potentially depending on results from earlier transformations.\n\n**Data Enrichment** augments records with data from external reference sources. The enrichment engine manages cache lookups, external service calls, and timeout handling.\n\n**Quality Scoring** evaluates each record against quality criteria and assigns a numeric score. Records below configured thresholds may be flagged, logged, or rejected depending on configuration.\n\n### Stage 5: Module Handoff (Beta to Gamma)\n\nTransformed records are batched for handoff to Module Gamma following the same batch protocol used between Alpha and Beta. The integration layer ensures reliable transfer with acknowledgment and retry support.\n\nBatch metadata is extended to include transformation summary statistics: record count, average quality score, error count, and enrichment hit rate. This metadata supports operational monitoring.\n\n### Stage 6: Output Rendering and Delivery\n\nModule Gamma receives transformed batches and routes individual records to their designated destinations. For each record:\n\n**Destination Determination** evaluates routing rules to identify target destinations. A record may have one or multiple destinations.\n\n**Format Rendering** converts the record to the format required by each destination. Rendering is performed independently for each destination, allowing different formats for the same record.\n\n**Delivery Execution** transmits the rendered record to the destination. The delivery engine manages connection pooling, authentication, and transmission protocols specific to each destination type.\n\n**Acknowledgment Processing** waits for confirmation of successful delivery. Confirmed records update completion tracking; failed records enter retry queues.\n\n### Stage 7: Completion and Reconciliation\n\nWhen all records in a batch have been delivered (or routed to dead letter queue after retry exhaustion), Gamma reports batch completion to upstream modules. Completion reports include delivery statistics: success count, retry count, DLQ count, and timing metrics.\n\nThe pipeline maintains end-to-end tracking that enables reconciliation between ingested and delivered records. Discrepancies trigger alerts for operator investigation.\n\n---\n\n## Cross-Cutting Concerns\n\nSeveral concerns span multiple modules and require coordinated implementation. This section describes these cross-cutting aspects and references their detailed specifications.\n\n### Error Handling Philosophy\n\nThe Data Pipeline System follows a \"fail forward\" error handling philosophy. Individual record failures do not halt pipeline execution. Instead, failed records are isolated, logged with diagnostic information, and routed to appropriate error handling channels while processing continues for valid records.\n\nError handling operates at multiple levels:\n\n**Record-Level Errors** affect individual records and are handled within the module where they occur. The record is marked as failed, diagnostic information is captured, and the record is routed to the module's error queue.\n\n**Batch-Level Errors** affect entire batches (e.g., network failures during handoff) and are handled by the integration layer's retry mechanisms.\n\n**Module-Level Errors** affect module operation (e.g., resource exhaustion) and may require operator intervention.\n\nEach module documents its specific error handling behaviors. For cross-module error propagation patterns, see `integration-layer.md`.\n\n### Logging and Observability\n\nAll modules emit structured log entries following a common format that enables log aggregation and analysis. Log entries include:\n\n- Timestamp in ISO 8601 format\n- Module identifier\n- Log level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)\n- Correlation ID linking related entries\n- Structured payload with context-specific fields\n\nMetrics are emitted via a standard metrics interface supporting integration with Prometheus, StatsD, and similar platforms. Standard metrics include throughput rates, latency percentiles, error rates, and resource utilization.\n\nHealth check endpoints expose module status for load balancer and orchestration platform integration. See `integration-layer.md` for health check specifications.\n\n### Compliance and Audit Requirements\n\nThe pipeline supports compliance requirements through comprehensive audit logging and data lineage tracking. Audit events capture:\n\n- Data origin and ingestion timestamp\n- All transformation operations applied\n- Delivery confirmation with destination and timestamp\n- User or system actions affecting pipeline configuration\n\nAudit logs are retained according to configurable policies and can be exported to external audit systems. Compliance requirements are detailed in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nSecurity is implemented through multiple mechanisms:\n\n**Transport Security**: All inter-module communication uses TLS encryption. External connections support TLS with certificate validation.\n\n**Authentication**: Source and destination connections use appropriate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, certificates, database credentials).\n\n**Authorization**: Pipeline operations are governed by role-based access control. Configuration changes require elevated privileges.\n\n**Data Protection**: Sensitive fields can be encrypted at rest and in transit. Field-level encryption supports scenarios where certain fields must remain protected through the pipeline.\n\nDetailed security requirements are specified in `compliance-requirements.md`.\n\n---\n\n## Configuration Management\n\nPipeline configuration follows a hierarchical model where default values can be overridden at increasingly specific levels.\n\n### Configuration Hierarchy\n\n1. **System Defaults**: Built-in defaults for all configuration parameters\n2. **Environment Configuration**: Environment-specific settings (dev, staging, production)\n3. **Module Configuration**: Module-specific parameter overrides\n4. **Source/Destination Configuration**: Settings for specific sources or destinations\n\nLower levels in the hierarchy override higher levels, allowing targeted configuration while maintaining sensible defaults.\n\n### Configuration Parameters\n\nEach module defines its configuration parameters in its detailed specification. Cross-module parameters defined in this overview include:\n\n| Parameter | Default | Description |\n|-----------|---------|-------------|\n| `PIPELINE_NAME` | `default` | Identifier for this pipeline instance |\n| `LOG_LEVEL` | `INFO` | Minimum log level to emit |\n| `METRICS_ENABLED` | `true` | Whether to emit metrics |\n| `METRICS_PREFIX` | `datapipeline` | Prefix for metric names |\n| `HEALTH_CHECK_PORT` | `8080` | Port for health check endpoint |\n\n### Configuration Updates\n\nConfiguration changes can be applied without pipeline restart through the configuration reload mechanism. Modules detect configuration changes and apply them at safe points in processing.\n\nSome parameters require restart due to their nature (e.g., network ports, resource pool sizes). These are documented in module specifications.\n\n---\n\n## Deployment Considerations\n\nThe Data Pipeline System supports various deployment models from single-node development environments to distributed production clusters.\n\n### Deployment Modes\n\n**Standalone Mode**: All modules run within a single process, suitable for development, testing, and small-scale deployments. Inter-module communication uses in-memory queues.\n\n**Distributed Mode**: Each module runs as an independent service, communicating via network protocols. This mode supports horizontal scaling and fault isolation.\n\n**Hybrid Mode**: Selected modules are co-located while others run independently, balancing deployment complexity against scaling requirements.\n\n### Scaling Considerations\n\n**Module Alpha** scales based on source volume and variety. Multiple Alpha instances can partition source responsibility, or a single instance can handle multiple sources with connection pooling.\n\n**Module Beta** scales based on transformation complexity. Transformation is inherently parallelizable; adding Beta instances provides near-linear throughput improvement.\n\n**Module Gamma** scales based on destination count and delivery latency. Destinations with high latency may require dedicated Gamma instances to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### High Availability\n\nProduction deployments should include:\n\n- Multiple instances of each module for failover\n- Health monitoring with automatic instance replacement\n- Persistent queues between modules to prevent data loss during failures\n- Geographic distribution for disaster recovery scenarios\n\n---\n\n## Document References\n\nThis overview document provides architectural context for the Data Pipeline System.

Here are my findings:\n\n### **Critical Issues**\n\n**1. Missing Message Format Definition**\n\nTask 1.1 says \"Define StreamingHandoffMessage structure with single-record and micro-batch variants\" but doesn't specify where this definition belongs. The authoritative location is `integration-layer.md` under \"Message Formats\". The task should explicitly state this, and the WPD should include at minimum:\n- Expected fields (will it extend MessageHeader? BatchMetadata?)\n- How single-record vs micro-batch variants are distinguished\n- Checksum scope for single records vs micro-batches\n\n**2. Missing Mode Selection/Negotiation Mechanism**\n\nTask 2.2 adds `STREAMING_MODE_ENABLED` but the WPD doesn't address:\n- How Beta discovers that Alpha is in streaming mode\n- Whether mode can change mid-session\n- Whether the config parameter belongs in Alpha, Beta, or both (integration-layer.md has cross-module config)\n- What happens if Alpha is in streaming mode but Beta isn't prepared for it\n\n**3. Acknowledgment Pattern Underspecified**\n\nTask 1.2 mentions \"record-level acknowledgment\" but this conflicts with the current protocol's two-phase batch acknowledgment (RECEIVED → PROCESSED). The WPD doesn't clarify:\n- Does streaming mode use single-phase or two-phase acknowledgment?\n- What's the `AcknowledgmentPayload.status` for streaming? (Currently: RECEIVED, PROCESSED, REJECTED)\n- How does record-level ACK interact with the `correlation_id` chain?\n\n**4. Compliance Impact Not Addressed**\n\nThe compliance-requirements.md has specific streaming-relevant requirements:\n- **Requirement 3.4**: Audit logs must be synchronized within one second accuracy\n- **Requirement 4.2**: Lineage must capture transformation operations\n- **Requirement 5.2**: Every ingested record must be logged\n\nFor high-frequency streaming, these create potential bottlenecks. The WPD doesn't address whether streaming mode affects audit frequency or introduces batched audit writes.\n\n**5. No Backward Compatibility / Mode Coexistence Strategy**\n\nThe overview mentions \"support streaming mode alongside batch mode\" but the tasks don't address:\n- How does Alpha decide which mode to use for a given record/batch?\n- Can Alpha dynamically switch between modes based on throughput?\n- What triggers mode selection?\n\n### **Gaps and Missing Elements**\n\n**6. No Error Handling Specification**\n\nThe current protocol has detailed retry behavior (`ALPHA_BETA_RETRY_DELAY_MS`, `ALPHA_BETA_MAX_RETRIES`, exponential backoff). For streaming:\n- What's the retry strategy for a single failed record?\n- Does a failed streaming record block subsequent records?\n- How does circuit breaker behavior change for streaming?\n\n**7. Missing Metrics Specification**\n\nTask 3.2 says \"Add latency metrics for streaming mode\" but doesn't specify:\n- Which specific metrics (per-record latency? transfer latency histogram?)\n- Where these metrics are defined (module-alpha.md and module-beta.md both have metrics sections)\n- Whether existing batch metrics need adaptation\n\n**8. Phase 3 Documentation Task Too Vague**\n\nTask 3.1 says \"Update the Alpha-to-Beta Protocol section\" but should enumerate:\n- Protocol Flow diagram updates\n- New message format additions\n- New configuration parameters\n- Updated retry behavior\n\n**9. Missing Testing/Validation Phase**\n\nThere's no phase for:\n- Performance testing streaming vs batch\n- Validating compliance under streaming load\n- Regression testing existing batch functionality\n\n**10. Buffer Overflow / Back-Pressure in Streaming Mode**\n\nThe current system has `BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK` and `BUFFER_LOW_WATERMARK` for batch mode. Task 1.3 mentions \"back-pressure signaling for streaming mode\" but:\n- Does streaming use the same watermark thresholds?\n- How does `BackPressureSignal` change? (Currently has `recommended_delay_ms` which may not suit streaming)\n- What's the \"recommended_delay\" equivalent for streaming - pause duration? record count limit?\n\n---\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n| # | Type | Issue |\n|---|------|-------|\n| 1 | Critical | Message format definition location and structure unspecified |\n| 2 | Critical | Mode negotiation/discovery mechanism missing |\n| 3 | Critical | Acknowledgment pattern conflict with existing protocol |\n| 4 | Critical | Compliance requirements impact not assessed |\n| 5 | Critical | Mode selection/coexistence strategy missing |\n| 6 | Gap | Error handling for streaming not specified |\n| 7 | Gap | Metrics specification too vague |\n| 8 | Gap | Documentation task underspecified |\n| 9 | Gap | No testing/validation phase |\n| 10 | Gap | Back-pressure mechanism adaptation unclear |\n\nWould you like to discuss any of these findings, or should I propose specific amendments to the WPD?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":6066,"cache_read_input_tokens":114437,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":6066,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1212,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXA5GuSSdrvvUByMpLCHc","type":"assistant","uuid":"1d26d68c-868f-4b07-bfb0-d4a81c3ea3ca","timestamp":"2026-01-16T00:01:36.220Z"}

I need to look at all my Read tool calls and their results.\n\nLooking back at my tool calls:\n\n1. First set of reads at the beginning:\n   - `docs/core/PRD.md` - returned actual content (line numbers 1-239)\n   - `docs/core/Experiment-Methodology.md` - returned error \"File does not exist\"\n   - `docs/core/Action-Plan.md` - returned actual content (line numbers 1-62)\n\n2. The `/wsd:boot` command loaded files via the Skill tool, which showed system reminders with the actual content being read\n\n3. After generating my Workscope ID, I ran:\n   - `bash scripts/init_work_journal.sh` - returned output showing journal initialization\n\n4. Then I read the Work Journal:\n   - `dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260115-155448.md` - returned actual content (4 lines)\n\n5. The Project-Bootstrapper agent was invoked via Task tool\n\n6. Then I read standards files:\n   - `docs/read-only/standards/Coding-Standards.md` - returned actual content (18 lines)\n   - `docs/read-only/standards/Python-Standards.md` - returned actual content (35 lines)\n   - `docs/read-only/standards/Specification-Maintenance-Standards.md` - returned actual content (445 lines)\n\n7.
