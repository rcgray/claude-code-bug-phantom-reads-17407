❯ /wsd:init --custom 

⏺ I acknowledge that I have read the content in the wsd-init-project-introduction section. This is the "Phantom Reads Investigation" project - a repository for reproducing Claude Code Issue #17407 ("Phantom Reads"). Let me read the required documents.

⏺ Read(docs/core/PRD.md)
  ⎿  Read 239 lines

⏺ Read(docs/core/Experiment-Methodology.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

⏺ Read(docs/core/Action-Plan.md)
  ⎿  Read 62 lines

⏺ I've read the core project documents. Note that docs/core/Experiment-Methodology.md doesn't exist (the actual file is docs/core/Experiment-Methodology-01.md). I understand this is a project to reproduce the "Phantom Reads" bug in Claude Code (Issue #17407).

  Now let me run the /wsd:boot command to load the Workscope-Dev Platform documentation.

  ⎿  Read docs/read-only/Checkboxlist-System.md (386 lines)
  ⎿  Read docs/read-only/Workscope-System.md (551 lines)

⏺ I have read all the WSD Platform documentation files:
  - Agent-System.md - Agent collaboration and workflow
  - Agent-Rules.md - Strict rules for all agents
  - Design-Decisions.md - Project-specific design philosophies
  - Documentation-System.md - Documentation organization
  - Checkboxlist-System.md - Task management and checkbox states
  - Workscope-System.md - Work assignment and tracking

  Now let me continue with the initialization steps. First, I need to generate a Workscope ID from the current timestamp.

⏺ Bash(date '+%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')
  ⎿  20260115-155448

⏺ Workscope ID: 20260115-155448

  Now let me initialize the Work Journal using the provided script.

⏺ Bash(bash /Users/gray/Projects/phantom-read-clone/scripts/init_work_journal.sh
       "20260115-155448")
  ⎿  Work Journal initialized: dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-2026
     0115-155448.md
     Timestamp: 2026-01-15 15:57
     … +3 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Let me verify the Work Journal was created properly.

⏺ Read(dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260115-155448.md)
  ⎿  Read 4 lines

⏺ The Work Journal has been created at dev/journal/archive/Journal-Workscope-20260115-155448.md with the correct filename format.

  Since the --custom flag was provided, I need to:
  1. Run the /wsd:onboard command
  2. Skip Task-Master assignment
  3. Return to the User for a custom workscope

  Let me run the onboarding command.

⏺ Skill(wsd:onboard)
  ⎿  Successfully loaded skill

⏺ Let me consult the Project-Bootstrapper agent for onboarding. Since I was initialized with --custom, I don't yet have a specific workscope description - the User will provide this after initialization completes.

  ⎿  Done (15 tool uses · 48.8k tokens · 1m 39s)                           

⏺ I have received comprehensive onboarding from the Project-Bootstrapper. Now let me read the mandatory files and update my Work Journal.

⏺ Now I'll present my assessment of the WPD.

  Assessment: Update Alpha-Beta Handoff Protocol for Streaming Mode

  I've thoroughly reviewed the target WPD against all referenced specifications. Here are my findings:

  Critical Issues

  1. Missing Message Format Definition

  Task 1.1 says "Define StreamingHandoffMessage structure with single-record and micro-batch variants" but doesn't specify where this definition belongs. The authoritative location is integration-layer.md under "Message Formats". The task should explicitly state this, and the WPD should include at minimum:
  - Expected fields (will it extend MessageHeader? BatchMetadata?)
  - How single-record vs micro-batch variants are distinguished
  - Checksum scope for single records vs micro-batches

  2. Missing Mode Selection/Negotiation Mechanism

  Task 2.2 adds STREAMING_MODE_ENABLED but the WPD doesn't address:
  - How Beta discovers that Alpha is in streaming mode
  - Whether mode can change mid-session
  - Whether the config parameter belongs in Alpha, Beta, or both (integration-layer.md has cross-module config)
  - What happens if Alpha is in streaming mode but Beta isn't prepared for it

  3. Acknowledgment Pattern Underspecified

  Task 1.2 mentions "record-level acknowledgment" but this conflicts with the current protocol's two-phase batch acknowledgment (RECEIVED → PROCESSED). The WPD doesn't clarify:
  - Does streaming mode use single-phase or two-phase acknowledgment?
  - What's the AcknowledgmentPayload.status for streaming? (Currently: RECEIVED, PROCESSED, REJECTED)
  - How does record-level ACK interact with the correlation_id chain?

  4. Compliance Impact Not Addressed

  The compliance-requirements.md has specific streaming-relevant requirements:
  - Requirement 3.4: Audit logs must be synchronized within one second accuracy
  - Requirement 4.2: Lineage must capture transformation operations
  - Requirement 5.2: Every ingested record must be logged

  For high-frequency streaming, these create potential bottlenecks. The WPD doesn't address whether streaming mode affects audit frequency or introduces batched audit writes.

  5. No Backward Compatibility / Mode Coexistence Strategy

  The overview mentions "support streaming mode alongside batch mode" but the tasks don't address:
  - How does Alpha decide which mode to use for a given record/batch?
  - Can Alpha dynamically switch between modes based on throughput?
  - What triggers mode selection?

  Gaps and Missing Elements

  6. No Error Handling Specification

  The current protocol has detailed retry behavior (ALPHA_BETA_RETRY_DELAY_MS, ALPHA_BETA_MAX_RETRIES, exponential backoff). For streaming:
  - What's the retry strategy for a single failed record?
  - Does a failed streaming record block subsequent records?
  - How does circuit breaker behavior change for streaming?

  7. Missing Metrics Specification

  Task 3.2 says "Add latency metrics for streaming mode" but doesn't specify:
  - Which specific metrics (per-record latency? transfer latency histogram?)
  - Where these metrics are defined (module-alpha.md and module-beta.md both have metrics sections)
  - Whether existing batch metrics need adaptation

  8. Phase 3 Documentation Task Too Vague

  Task 3.1 says "Update the Alpha-to-Beta Protocol section" but should enumerate:
  - Protocol Flow diagram updates
  - New message format additions
  - New configuration parameters
  - Updated retry behavior

  9. Missing Testing/Validation Phase

  There's no phase for:
  - Performance testing streaming vs batch
  - Validating compliance under streaming load
  - Regression testing existing batch functionality

  10. Buffer Overflow / Back-Pressure in Streaming Mode

  The current system has BUFFER_HIGH_WATERMARK and BUFFER_LOW_WATERMARK for batch mode. Task 1.3 mentions "back-pressure signaling for streaming mode" but:
  - Does streaming use the same watermark thresholds?
  - How does BackPressureSignal change? (Currently has recommended_delay_ms which may not suit streaming)
  - What's the "recommended_delay" equivalent for streaming - pause duration? record count limit?

❯ We have recently seen a number of User Agents reporting issues reading    
  files like the following:                                                 
                                                                            
  <session-agent-response>                                                  
  Looking back at my history, you're right. My first Read call for the file 
  returned:

  I did not follow up with a Read call to view that persisted output. I     
  proceeded with my "investigation" without ever having actually read the   
  file contents. I was operating completely blind, making assumptions about 
  a document I never saw.                                                   
                                                                            
  The same thing happened with several other files at the start -           
  WSD-Runtime-Metadata-Schema.md, WSD-Manifest-Schema.md,                   
  Manifest-Driven-Pipeline-Overview.md all returned <persisted-output>      
  messages that I never followed up on                                      
  </session-agent-response>                                                 
                                                                            
  I am debugging this recurring issue and I am checking to see if this      
  particular session is a reproduction of this issue. Did you experience    
  this during your execution of the command?                                

⏺ This is directly relevant to the project I'm working in - let me check my session history carefully.

  No, I did NOT experience the Phantom Reads issue during this session.

  All reads returned actual file contents with line numbers (e.g., 1→, 2→, etc.). I did not receive any <persisted-output> markers that would have required follow-up reads.

  The WSD system files loaded during /wsd:boot were also delivered inline via the Skill tool's system reminders.

  This session is NOT a reproduction of the phantom reads issue.
