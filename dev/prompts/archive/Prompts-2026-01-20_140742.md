We've been busy the past few days. We collected a number of extra Trials from the WSD Development project, creating the `wsd-dev-02` collection. We also created a pre-processing tool (`.claude/commands/update-trial-data.md`) that filters data from a Trial into a `trial_data.json` file that can be used for more broad analysis. We further updated that tool with token counts for the files (`dev/misc/wsd-dev-02/file_token_counts.json`) and analyzed the Trials to further refine our three theories: Reset Theory, Headroom Theory, and Reset-Timing Theory.  Results from three analyses on the wsd-dev-02 collection (at varying levels of sophistication of our `trial_data.json` files) have been performed:

- `docs/core/WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-1.md` ( @docs/core/WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-1.md )
- `docs/core/WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-2.md` ( @docs/core/WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-2.md )
- `docs/core/WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-3.md` ( @docs/core/WSD-Dev-02-Analysis-3.md )

It's time to update our `docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md` ( @docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md ) with our latest work.

We should also take a look at our `README.md` file ( @README.md ), given how much the investigation has progressed. Keeping in mind our target audience (folks who are interested in tracking the progress), how should we update our "front page" to let them know both key information like the definition of phantom reads and the workaround as well as our dismissed and working theories and progress of the investigation?

We want this to be concise yet informative.  But it's been a while since we updated it, so we should take a look now. You have a fresh understanding of our Investigation Journal, so you would be a good User Agent to address this.
