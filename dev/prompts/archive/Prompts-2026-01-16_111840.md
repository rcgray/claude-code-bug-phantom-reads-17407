pyproject.toml exists because this was previously a codeless WSD project. However, actual Python scripts are being added now, meaning that we need to update to support a true Python (script) development project. This means we need to update our pyproject.toml for proper tooling, bring in pytest and establish automated tests, linting, formatting, etc.

---

Yes - we will want to make sure we have everything we need to support `wsd health`, `wsd test`, and `wsd docs:full` (which means pdoc as well). check_dirs is just `scripts/`, which will contain the standard WSD scripts and a couple of project-specific scripts (still in development). We've just barely started development on `scripts/cc_version.py`, but it will be better to establish this now for higher-quality AI code output (i.e., it will let us re-establish the Test-Guardian and Health-Inspector agents in the QA loop). You should have what you need from the end-user guides in `dev/wsd`.  But for the most part, your plan looks correct.

---

To avoid clashing with WSD scripts, I've moved this project's development to `src/`.  I made manual updates as necessary to existing specs and code, and I updated the `pyproject.toml` file.  `wsd health` now simply shows the Type Check error in `src/cc_version.py`.

Two things I'd like to fix:

1) What is this error that now pops up whenever I run anything: "warning: The `tool.uv.dev-dependencies` field (used in `pyproject.toml`) is deprecated and will be removed in a future release; use `dependency-groups.dev` instead". Let's fix that

2) Let's fix the health check error:
```
Health Check: Running Type checking (mypy)...
Health Check: Type checking (mypy) found issues (exit code: 1)
Output:
 src/cc_version.py:172: error: Returning Any from function declared to return "dict[str, Any]"  [no-any-return]
Found 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)
```
