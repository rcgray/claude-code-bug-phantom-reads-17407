When we wrote the `docs/features/collect-trials-script/Collect-Trials-Script-Overview.md` feature overview spec, we did not have proper Python tooling in this project. We've since fixed this, and I would like to create automated tests for this feature (recently completed). What I would like for you to do is examine this spec and create a comprehensive set of test cases that we will add as a Phase 6 to the feature overview spec.

1. Examine the spec and construct a comprehensive test plan.
2. Consider the aspects of the implementation (e.g. dependency injection) that may need to be updated in order to support automated unit tests.
3. Write a new section in the feature overview spec description that discusses these changes and the test plan.
4. Update the FIP as needed in each phase to provide test coverage for the aspects of the feature being implemented in that phase according to your test plan.
5. Update the FIP with a new Phase 6 (pushing existing subsequent phases down in number) that covers any additional testing work according to your test plan.

Do not do all of these steps in one go. First, let's perform Step 1 and Step 2. Then come back and report.

Phase 1 was "assigned" by the Task-Master accidentally in a false-start workscope that was aborted (but not properly reverted). And yes, we are creating a test plan for a feature that hasn't been implemented.

The WSD system is set up to handle TDD, primarly throught the In-Flight Failures (IFF) concept. The QA Special Agents, in particular the Test-Guardian and Health-Inspector agents, are very strict and by design do not function with all knowledge of the project in progress. This means that a single failing test will flag as an error introduced by the agent implementing the workscope. We manage this through IFF documentation, where an agent who knows that a multi-workscope task will have a short interim period of known failures (until the WPD is completed) can mark these as "known failures" in order to satisfy these QA Special Agents. I apologize, the `Collect-Trials-Script-Overview.md` spec was apparently created without the reserved "IFF" section, but I have now added it.

The IFF concept has an additional benefit in that it allows us to functionally implement TDD practices if we so choose. To simplify things, we generally create our test plan ahead of time but implement tests _after_ we implement code in order to avoid confusion among our agents.  Since you suggested TDD, it might be interesting here to actually try it, but that of course would require some rearranging of our FIP to write our tests (intentionally failing) in the earlier steps. I'd like to hear your thoughts on this, and if we decide to do so, we will need to populate our IFF section with an explanation of our TDD approach and careful documentation of the tests that are expected to fail (where this list will be updated as tests begin to pass).

Your test plan looks good. Let me know what you think we should do with regard to TDD or post-implementation test writing, given what you understand about AI assistant development and the WSD system.

Please create a writeup for this as an artifact in the workbench, including as much detail as you did and even going deeper. I think this is a topic I want to explore further, but I don't want to lose focus on our task at hand.

Afterward, you may proceed with your proposed Option A and update the ticket to integrate your new test plan.
