Read the `docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md` ( @docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md ) to catch up on our latest state. Tell me about your understanding of our current theories.

So what does this mean for `Experiment-Methodology-04` now?  I had a conversation with a previous agent who had a plan they were supposed to write down, but I'm not sure they did. Do you see any plans about `module-phi.md`?

---

We should focus on #1, aiming to create two new files `module-epsilon.md` and `module-phi.md` (each around the same size as `module-beta.md`) with convincing material for our scenario, and then we need to integrate them into the existing specs (cross-references, etc.).  The work to do this should be added to the existing `docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md` ( @docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md ) spec, both in the description and as an additional Phase in the FIP.

If you have a clear idea of how to do this, I would say just go ahead. Otherwise, feel free to ask any questions.

---

Your instructions here were to update the `docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md` spec for the changes that we were PLANNING to do.  But it appears you 1) Just did all the changes, and then 2) created unchecked (`[ ]`, meaning not yet addressed) work items for the work that you just did.

You performed poorly on this, and now we're in a bad situation - we need to reconcile this list you just added (Phase 10) with the work that you jumped ahead and performed without permission.  We have a way of handling this, and that is to mark the work items as `[%]` - meaning that they can still be processed in a proper way (with QA checks, etc.), but we don't have to throw away the work you've done.  Don't UNDO the work you've done improperly, but now we must document it.

The Phase 10 itself is the Source of Truth, not whatever other changes you've made toward implementing Phase 10. All of those other changes are all invalid until they are processed via formal workscopes. However, we can't even do that unless we have a proper assessment of the state of those tasks in the Phase 10 items of the FIP.

Please pay close attention. Your focus right now is on ensuring that the Phase 10 of the FIP properly reflects the state of our project.

## New Session: Claude Code v2.1.6: `opus` (locked, 2.1.15 is current)
## Action Plan: `docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md`
## Phases: 10

---

/wsd:init, /wsd:prepare, /wsd:execute, /wsd:close

---

In our `docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md` file, I've updated the actual line counts and token counts for the files in our experiment. You'll see where I've added the data, but I would like you to update this data to match the existing presentation.
