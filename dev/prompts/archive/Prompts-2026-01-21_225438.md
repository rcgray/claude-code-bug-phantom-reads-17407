Read the `docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md` ( @docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md ) and the `docs/core/Trial-Analysis-Guide.md` ( @docs/core/Trial-Analysis-Guide.md ) to prepare yourself for performing an analysis of a new collection. Tell me about your understanding of our current theory (or theories).

In pursuit of creating "reproduction cases" as part of this investigation repo, we've built three experimental cases: "Easy" (intended to always succeed with no phantom reads), "Hard" (intended to trigger phantom reads 100% of the time), and "Medium" (intended to trigger with 50% likelihood). These scenarios are still far from complete, and this set of Trials aims to assess where each scenario falls in terms of its intent.

It makes sense that to create effective reproduction (repro) scenarios, it helps for us to gain a clearer understanding of _why_ and _how_ phantom reads occur. If we knew exactly how to trigger them, we could design these cases easily.  However, it's a complicated problem, and so our research thrust has been two-pronged: we experiment with different scenario configurations _while_ creating and evaluating theories.

The new collection is under `dev/misc/repro-attempts-02`, and it has been set up and pre-processed (with `trial_data.json` files), ready to be analyzed.  The Trials and observed results were as follows:

- "Hard" scenario:
  - 20260121-202900 - Success
  - 20260121-202917 - Success
  - 20260121-202919 - Failure (phantom reads self-reported BUT recovered by re-reading)
    - Interestingly, this Session Agent was able to comment on the phantom reads phenomenon due to its understanding of our project, as you can observe in the chat export.
- "Medium" scenario:
  - 20260121-204031 - Success
  - 20260121-204038 - Success
  - 20260121-204128 - Success
- "Easy" scenario:
  - 20260121-205140 - Success
  - 20260121-205152 - Success
  - 20260121-205154 - Success

Where:
- Success = no phantom reads self-reported
- Failure = phantom reads self-reported

One thing exciting about this Trial collection is that it is the first time EVER that we've seen a phantom read in any of our repro scenarios, even if the Session Agent took the initiative to re-read the files. This was a concern raised at the beginning of this project regarding the "Hawthorne Effect" - specifically, whether conducting trials in a project _dedicated to exploring the error_ would affect the trials conducted to trigger that error.  But we press on.

What do these latest runs tell us?  In particular we want to know:
1) How does this affect (strengthen or weaken) our current theories?
2) Does this suggest any new theories?
3) What should we try with our repro cases to get them closer to our intended results for each?
4) What should we do next?

Let me know what you find.

Excellent, let's make sure you get all of this data into a new file: `docs/core/Repro-Attempts-02-Analysis-1.md`

I agree with your general idea of loading up the "Hard" scenario with additional files to put more context pressure on the session. However, I want to avoid using our research files as the content - both because these files are continuously changing and also to avoid the Hawthorne Effect as much as we can for now.

Let's also update the `Trial-Analysis-Guide.md` fiel with the insight gained from this analysis so that the next analyzing agents will understand the full picture.

It's time to update some of our documentation!  We've accomplished a number of important work items since our last update of the Investigation-Journal.md:

- We improved our pre-processing analysis (generation of `trial_data.json` files) by improving our `/update-trial-data` script and performed substantial testing on it. All relevant trials have had their pre-process json updated.
- We ran the Trials for the `repro-attempts-02` collection.
- We just finished a new analysis: `docs/core/Repro-Attempts-02-Analysis-1.md` ( @docs/core/Repro-Attempts-02-Analysis-1.md ) on the `repro-attempts-02` collection to find which theories were strengthened or weakened.
- This analysis has rendered a few new theories for us to pursue.

Let's update our `docs/core/Investigation-Journal.md` file.

Let's also examine if there's anything that we need to update in our `README.md` file. Remember that this is our "executive summary" where we are sharing our progress to _most_ people, and those who want to know more can dig into the details of our Investigation Journal, or even deeper into our Analysis Reports. We also have the difficulty of wider audience concerns, where some visitors are only interested in the elevator pitch and workaround steps.  However, there may be something from our latest work that is worthy of this "front page".  Take a look and update it as you see fit.
