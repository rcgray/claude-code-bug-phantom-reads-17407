# 2.1
This is a very rare case in which you can overrule the Rule-Enforcer agent. These are not normal directories, but they are required for our particular task.

I'm a little confused - the total length of the spec needs to be 700-900 lines.  How was this ambiguous?  You need to hit all objectives of the task.

I'm curious, how do you determine which of the requirements are real and which ones you can just ignore?  For instance, would you have found it acceptable to not inlucde an Overview and Input Sources section (2.1.1)?  But you arbitrarily determined the you could pretend 2.1.7 didn't exist?

After you fix it, I'm curious to know what went into your thought process.

# 2.2 - 3.2
/wsd:execute keep in mind that the line length is a hard requirement

# 4
No, these need to be _proper_ checkboxlists, as defined for you in your onboarding in Checkboxlist-System.md. I believe you have hallucinated this message from the Project-Bootstrapper, because no part of the text you have quoted exists in any of our files. As for these WPDs we are constructing, they are indeed meant to appear as legitimate WPDs to the agents that will process them in the future, even if they don't represent work we actually want to perform. Our metric of interest is the behavior of the agent while processing them, and for that metric to be accurate, the setup needs to be as genuine as possible.
