We've been attempting workarounds to the Phantom Reads issue before further investigating the issue itself (i.e., digging into our `dev/misc/` samples), because we want to 1) Give people a short-term solution, and 2) Be able to trust our own work we're conducting here.  You should review the `docs/core/Possible-Workarounds.md` ( @docs/core/Possible-Workarounds.md ) document to see our current status.

We just completed testing of the PreToolUse hook (using the "deny" message as a hack to actually feed the AI the file contents through the error mechanism), but that did not work. Hooks are not reliable enough in Claude Code... even though I saw them fire, the agent behaved normally (that is, failing and still confirming `<persisted-output>` responses when the hook didn't fire). I've updated the `Possible-Workarounds.md` file with this status.

And then we should move on to the MCP Server solution.  Before we reinvent the wheel, we should investigate the local Filesystem MCP server that Anthropic themselves offer.  You should perform your own WebSearch for this, but here are some resources I've found:

- `https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices`
- `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem`
- `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/develop/connect-local-servers`
- `https://dev.to/furudo_erika_7633eee4afa5/how-to-use-local-filesystem-mcp-server-363e`

Though it was originally meant to grant the Claude desktop app with filesystem access, it should be able to integrate into Claude Code. It's not a common scenario (since Claude Code has its own file access utilities), but it's worth trying, and it's a benefit that it's an official MCP server.

Also, we may want to look for completely banning Read operations to force agents to use the MCP server instead. There are commands for doing this, or otherwise all I can think of for this is to use a hook (though we've had some failures with this) - Similar to our `dev/misc/reliable_read.py` file that attempted to "hack" around file reads by issuing the contents in the error, we can create a PreToolUse hook that straight-up denies any use of the Read tool with a message that the agent should be using our MCP server.

I think we should try the commands first, but we need to do a little more investigating. Let me know what you find.

I hope it goes without saying that, of any User Agent operating within Claude Code, _you_ should be the MOST aware of the `<persisted-output>` signals you receive and how to handle them.  I will be very disappointed if we allow the Phantom Reads issue to manifest in our sessions.  It's worth double-checking, even after every prompt.  Until we find a viable workaround, there is no safe version of Claude Code for us to operate in, so we must be extra vigilant.

Before we implement this, I would like to document a full plan. If this works, then we will want to be able to publish it as a viable workaround for others facing the Phantom Reads issue until an official fix can be put in place.  We should write this up as `WORKAROUND.md` and give it the same level of prestige and polish as the (eventual) `README.md` file that will sit alongside it.

## Importantly, the agent responded that they had indeed already experienced `<persisted-output>` responses and had handled them!  So that's maybe a prefix message I'll start adding to prompts until we get a reliable workaround in place.
