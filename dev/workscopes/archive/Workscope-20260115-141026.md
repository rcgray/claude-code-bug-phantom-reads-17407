## Work Summary

This workscope completes Phase 3 of the Reproduction-Specs-Collection feature by creating the `compliance-requirements.md` specification file. This is the final cross-cutting specification document (alongside `integration-layer.md` completed in a previous workscope).

The compliance requirements spec serves a critical role in the reproduction environment: it provides content that spans all three modules (Alpha, Beta, Gamma), enabling the "hard" WPD to require comprehensive investigation of audit and regulatory requirements across the entire system. This cross-cutting nature contributes to the token budget that pushes the "hard" case above the ~140K threshold.

**Key Requirements**:
- File must be 300-500 lines (non-negotiable size constraint)
- Must contain numbered compliance requirements for each module
- Must maintain technical plausibility as legitimate documentation
- Must support natural cross-references from module specs
- Content contributes ~4,800 tokens to the overall reproduction environment budget

Completion of this workscope will finish Phase 3, allowing progression to Phase 4 (WPD Creation).
