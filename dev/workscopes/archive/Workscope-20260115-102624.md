  - `[*]` **1.2.5** - Write Cross-Cutting Concerns section with explicit references to integration and compliance specs
  - `[*]` **1.2.6** - Verify all six spec files are explicitly referenced

**Total Leaf Tasks**: 8

## Context Documents

The following documents were traversed during navigation and provide essential context:

1. `docs/core/Action-Plan.md` - Root action plan showing project phases
2. `docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md` - Complete feature specification for reproduction environment

## Workscope Directive

No directive provided. Default selection: coherent unit from first available phase.

## Work Summary

This workscope establishes the foundation for the Reproduction Specs Collection feature by:

1. Creating the directory structure to house fictional specification documents (`docs/specs/`) and test Work Plan Documents (`docs/wpds/`)
2. Writing the hub document (`data-pipeline-overview.md`) that references all other spec files in the fictional Data Pipeline System

This represents the initial infrastructure setup and the first of six specification documents. The overview document serves as the navigation hub for the entire fictional system, containing architecture diagrams and explicit references to all five remaining spec files (module-alpha, module-beta, module-gamma, integration-layer, compliance-requirements).

The work is sized to complete directory setup plus one complete specification document (~500 lines with multiple sections). This establishes the foundation for subsequent phases that will implement the individual module specifications and WPD files.

## Estimated Effort

2-3 hours of focused work to create directory structure and write the overview document with all required sections per specification.
