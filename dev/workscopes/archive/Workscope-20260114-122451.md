## Phase Inventory (Terminal Checkboxlist)
```
PHASE INVENTORY FOR update-session-analysis-spec-use-workscope-id.md:
Phase 0: Not applicable (no Phase 0 in this ticket)
Phase 1: CLEAR
Phase 2: 2.1 Update collection algorithm
Phase 3: 3.1 Update Error Handling section
Phase 4: 4.1 Remove obsolete FIP tasks
FIRST AVAILABLE PHASE: Phase 2
FIRST AVAILABLE ITEM: 2.1 Update collection algorithm
```

## Selected Tasks
The following tasks from `docs/tickets/open/update-session-analysis-spec-use-workscope-id.md` are assigned to this workscope:

- [ ] **2.1** - Update collection algorithm
  - [ ] **2.1.1** - Rename `extract_trial_id()` to `extract_workscope_id()`
  - [ ] **2.1.2** - Update regex pattern to match `Workscope ID:`
  - [ ] **2.1.3** - Update variable names (trial_id → workscope_id)
- [ ] **2.2** - Update file naming references

2. `docs/tickets/open/update-session-analysis-spec-use-workscope-id.md` - Terminal checkboxlist (work assignment location)
3. `docs/features/session-analysis-scripts/Session-Analysis-Scripts-Overview.md` - Primary target file to be updated

## Directive
No directive provided. Selected Phase 2 in its entirety (4 leaf tasks) for a coherent workscope focused on updating algorithm code examples.

## Work Summary
