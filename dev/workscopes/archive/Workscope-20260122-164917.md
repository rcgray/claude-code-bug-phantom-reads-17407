## Work Description

This workscope creates the unified target WPD (`pipeline-refactor.md`) for the command-based reproduction approach (v2.0). This WPD proposes a cross-cutting refactor (unified telemetry and observability framework) that requires thorough review of ALL six supporting specifications to provide meaningful critique.

The WPD serves as the analysis target for all three analysis commands (`/analyze-light`, `/analyze-standard`, `/analyze-thorough`) and is designed to expose gaps in understanding caused by phantom reads - agents cannot "wing it" without actually reading the specs.

Key design constraints:
- Must reference all six supporting specs explicitly in Scope section
- Must require thorough understanding of each module to provide meaningful critique
- Module Impact, Integration Impact, and Compliance Impact sections must tie to specific content in supporting specs
- Implementation Phases checkboxlist should span all modules (10-15 tasks)
- Cannot be completed superficially - the critique task must expose phantom read-induced gaps
