## Selected Tasks

The following tasks have been selected from Phase 10 of the Reproduction-Specs-Collection feature:

**Current State (Before Marking):**
- `[%]` 10.3.1 - Update `data-pipeline-overview.md` to reference module-epsilon and module-phi
- `[%]` 10.3.2 - Update `integration-layer.md` with caching and orchestration protocols
- `[%]` 10.3.3 - Update `pipeline-refactor.md` WPD to include new modules in scope
- `[%]` 10.4.1 - Update `.claude/commands/analyze-wpd.md` to list module-epsilon and module-phi in required reading
- `[ ]` 10.5.1 - Verify all cross-references are valid
- `[ ]` 10.5.3 - Run calibration trial with Hard scenario to verify phantom read triggering

**Task Summary:**
This workscope focuses on integrating the newly created module-epsilon and module-phi specifications into the existing reproduction environment. The work includes updating cross-references in existing specs, updating the unified target WPD, updating the analysis command, and running verification checks to ensure the integration is complete and functional.
