## Work Description

This workscope involves creating the `docs/specs/module-alpha.md` specification file, which describes the fictional data ingestion module for the Data Pipeline System reproduction environment. This is the first of three core module specifications needed for the phantom read reproduction trials.

The specification must be substantial (700-900 lines, approximately 9,600 tokens) to serve its role in the token manipulation strategy. The "easy" WPD will reference only this file, keeping token consumption low for baseline success cases.

Key requirements:
- Define named constants (especially `DEFAULT_BATCH_SIZE`) that serve as refactoring targets
- Include substantial Error Handling section (150+ lines minimum)
- Maintain technical plausibility (content must read as legitimate documentation)
- Include proper cross-references to integration-layer.md and compliance-requirements.md
- Hit the 700-900 line target to ensure proper token budget contribution
