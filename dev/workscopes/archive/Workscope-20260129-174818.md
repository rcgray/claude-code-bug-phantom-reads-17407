## Selected Tasks

**Phase 6: Update Analysis Guide**

- [ ] **6.1** - Update `docs/experiments/guides/Trial-Analysis-Guide.md` Section 3.4 ("Key Data Points in Session Files") to document the newly extracted usage fields (`cache_creation_tokens`, `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `total_input`) alongside the existing `cache_read_input_tokens`
- [ ] **6.2** - Add a new appendix (or extend existing appendices) documenting the `persistence_mapping` section: what each field means, how to interpret `persisted_reads` vs `non_persisted_reads` vs `persisted_non_reads`, and how `persisted_count` relates to `has_tool_results`
- [ ] **6.3** - Add documentation for the `compaction_loss` field: its formula, interpretation of positive vs negative values, and clarification that it is a per-reset single-trial metric distinct from the cross-trial "42K content gap" described in Step 1.4
- [ ] **6.4** - Update the Quick Reference table (Part 7) to include the new key metrics (`total_input_at_peak`, `compaction_loss`, `persisted_count`) with their sources and purposes

**Total Leaf Tasks**: 4
