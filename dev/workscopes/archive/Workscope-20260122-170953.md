## Work Description

This workscope focuses on completing the command-based reproduction environment by:

1. **Phase 7.2**: Validating that the unified target WPD (`pipeline-refactor.md`) requires thorough understanding of all supporting specs
2. **Phase 8.1**: Creating the first of three analysis commands (`analyze-light.md`) that uses the `@` notation preload mechanism

The work is coherent because both tasks are part of the same v2.0 command-based approach, and 8.1 depends on the WPD being properly validated in 7.2.

## Key Constraints

- The analysis commands must use `@` notation for file preloading (see specification lines 62-67)
- All three commands must have identical task structure—only preload differs (line 868)
- The WPD must reference all six supporting specs and require thorough understanding (lines 351-380)
- Leaf tasks only—parent items are never marked with `[*]`
