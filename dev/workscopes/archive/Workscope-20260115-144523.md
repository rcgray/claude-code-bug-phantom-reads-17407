## Phase 0 Status (Root Action-Plan.md)

**Status**: CLEAR

All Phase 0 items in `docs/core/Action-Plan.md` are complete (`[x]`). No blocking work exists.

## Context Documents

1. `docs/core/Action-Plan.md` - Root action plan with phase overview
2. `docs/features/reproduction-specs-collection/Reproduction-Specs-Collection-Overview.md` - Complete specification for reproduction environment including WPD requirements, token budgets, and success criteria
3. `docs/specs/data-pipeline-overview.md` - Hub document for the fictional Data Pipeline System (referenced by WPDs)
4. `docs/specs/module-alpha.md` - Ingestion module specification (referenced by easy WPD)
5. `docs/specs/module-beta.md` - Transformation module specification (referenced by medium and hard WPDs)
6. `docs/specs/module-gamma.md` - Output module specification (referenced by hard WPD)
7. `docs/specs/integration-layer.md` - Cross-module integration protocols (referenced by medium and hard WPDs)
8. `docs/specs/compliance-requirements.md` - Compliance requirements (referenced by hard WPD)

## Workscope Directive

No directive provided by User Agent. Default selection applied: coherent group of 3-7 items from first available phase.

Selection rationale: All of Phase 4 represents a complete, coherent unit of work (creating all three test WPD files). While this contains 9 leaf tasks, the three parent items (4.1, 4.2, 4.3) form a natural group that should be completed together.

---

## Notes

This workscope involves creating three test Work Plan Documents (WPDs) that will be used to trigger different token consumption patterns during reproduction trials:

- **refactor-easy.md**: Restricts investigation to single file, targets <100K tokens, expects 100% success
- **refactor-hard.md**: Forces investigation of all six specs, targets >150K tokens, expects 100% failure (phantom reads)
- **refactor-medium.md**: Targets threshold boundary at 130-155K tokens, expects mixed results

Each WPD must conform to the detailed requirements in the specification, particularly regarding:
1. Required Context section structure (controls which files agents read)
2. Directive language strength (ensures agents actually read the specified files)
3. Task count matching scope (3-5 for easy, 10-15 for hard, 6-8 for medium)

All six spec files already exist (completed in Phases 1-3), so this work focuses solely on creating the three test WPDs that reference them.
