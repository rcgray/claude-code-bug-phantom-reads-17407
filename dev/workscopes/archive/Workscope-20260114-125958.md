## Work Description

This workscope completes the final phase of updating the Session Analysis Scripts specification to use Workscope ID instead of the redundant `/start-trial` command. Phases 1-3 have already updated the main specification content, algorithm code, and prose/examples. This phase removes the obsolete Feature Implementation Plan tasks that referenced the now-deleted `/start-trial` command.

**Key Changes:**
- Remove FIP tasks for creating and testing the `/start-trial` command
- Renumber remaining FIP tasks to maintain sequential ordering
- Ensure the FIP accurately reflects the updated specification

**Completion Criteria:**
- All references to `/start-trial` command are removed from the FIP
- Task numbering is sequential and follows checkboxlist conventions
- The FIP aligns with the updated specification content
