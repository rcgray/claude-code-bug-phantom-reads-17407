## Notes

This workscope involves verification and measurement work for the architecture-deep-dive.md preload context file. The task requires:
1. Measuring the actual line count of the file
2. Verifying it meets the target of ~2,400 lines (±150)
3. Measuring the actual token count
4. Updating the specification with measured values if needed

This is a quality assurance task in Phase 6 of the Reproduction Specs Collection feature implementation.
