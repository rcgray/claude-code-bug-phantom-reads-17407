## Work Description

This workscope involves creating the `integration-layer.md` specification file as part of the Reproduction Specs Collection feature. This file documents the cross-module integration protocols for the fictional Data Pipeline System, including message formats, handoff protocols between modules, and crucially the Error Propagation section that will serve as the anchor for the "hard" WPD's cross-cutting refactor.

The specification requires 500-700 lines of content including detailed protocol definitions for Alpha-to-Beta and Beta-to-Gamma handoffs, and a substantial Error Propagation section (minimum 100 lines) that references error handling in all three modules. This file is critical to the reproduction environment's token budget, contributing approximately 7,200 tokens to the overall collection.

The content must read as legitimate technical documentation to ensure agents investigate normally during trials, and all cross-references to the three module specs must be valid and complete.
