## Implementation Notes

This validation workscope requires:

1. **File Reference Verification (5.1.1):**
   - Check all paths in WPD "Required Context" sections
   - Verify paths resolve to existing files in `docs/specs/`
   - Expected files: `refactor-easy.md`, `refactor-medium.md`, `refactor-hard.md`

2. **Cross-Reference Validation (5.1.2):**
   - Verify all cross-references within the six spec files point to valid sections
   - Check references between: overview → modules, modules → integration/compliance, integration → all modules

3. **Line Count Verification (5.1.3):**
   - Verify each spec meets its minimum line count per the specification
   - Expected ranges documented in "Spec File Requirements" section

These tasks are final validation before the reproduction environment can be considered complete and ready for trial execution.
